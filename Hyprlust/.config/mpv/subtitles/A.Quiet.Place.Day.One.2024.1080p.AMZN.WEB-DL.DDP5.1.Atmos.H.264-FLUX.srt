1
00:01:17,258 --> 00:01:18,290
Sam?

2
00:01:20,294 --> 00:01:21,326
Sam?

3
00:01:22,428 --> 00:01:23,922
Why don't you go ahead?

4
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,283
I'm gonna share a poem
I've been working on.

5
00:01:34,284 --> 00:01:37,969
I don't want to, but Reuben
said I had to, so...

6
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,442
I didn't say you had to.

7
00:01:39,443 --> 00:01:41,874
It's called
"This Place is Shit."

8
00:01:42,646 --> 00:01:44,216
Oh, good.

9
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:45,812
"This place is shit.

10
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:49,398
This place smells like shit.

11
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:51,851
Betsy's voice sounds like shit.

12
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,919
Cancer is shit.

13
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,723
Oscar does that stupid walk

14
00:01:56,724 --> 00:01:59,825
When he wants to hide
he shit his pants.

15
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:02,928
And Milton has
shit taste in music."

16
00:02:06,637 --> 00:02:08,670
It's not finished.

17
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:10,903
That was great.

18
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,542
That was great. Let's...

19
00:02:13,543 --> 00:02:15,677
- I'm gonna clap for that.
- Don't clap for it.

20
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:17,580
I'm gonna clap for it.

21
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:18,712
Clap for it.

22
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,761
I smell smoke.

23
00:02:34,762 --> 00:02:36,367
It's okay, everyone.

24
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:38,469
- How's your pain?
- Great.

25
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,636
Thanks for sharing today. Uh...

26
00:02:40,637 --> 00:02:42,539
Lot of profanity, but I, um,

27
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,441
I didn't appreciate the comment

28
00:02:44,442 --> 00:02:46,410
about Oscar's poop-walk.

29
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:48,379
- Oscar thought it was funny.
- It was funny,

30
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,975
- but it was still mean.
- I'm a very mean person.

31
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:54,386
- That's a very open realization.
- I've known that for a while.

32
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:57,554
Hey! We're going to a show.
Half an hour.

33
00:02:57,555 --> 00:02:59,819
Oh, see,
I might be dead by then.

34
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,459
Oh, yeah, you might.
But if you're not dead,

35
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,263
it's short
and it's in the city.

36
00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:07,245
When's the last time
you were in the city?

37
00:03:07,246 --> 00:03:09,896
Last time was supposed
to be the last time.

38
00:03:12,098 --> 00:03:13,834
Well, here's another time.

39
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:18,343
I'll go if we get pizza.

40
00:03:18,344 --> 00:03:20,346
Didn't we have pizza
yesterday?

41
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:21,908
- Did you eat it?
- No.

42
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:23,678
That wasn't pizza.

43
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:26,176
Okay, well, then, yeah, we'll
get pizza on the way back.

44
00:03:26,177 --> 00:03:27,452
In the city.

45
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:29,421
In the city.

46
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:35,262
- I'll go get changed.
- All right.

47
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:38,562
Let Katie know
if you need help!

48
00:03:38,563 --> 00:03:39,761
Yeah.

49
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:53,759
Quiet.

50
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,513
You're getting fat.

51
00:05:37,144 --> 00:05:39,815
Thank you so much.

52
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:42,350
All right, guys,
this is a little bit steep.

53
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:44,886
So grab onto the railing
if you need help.

54
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:50,254
Um, and remember,
go bad leg first.

55
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:53,663
It's a puppet show.

56
00:05:53,664 --> 00:05:56,700
It's a marionette show.
We are the marionette club.

57
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:58,636
- You lied.
- I don't know if I lied.

58
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:00,363
You could've checked
the schedule.

59
00:06:00,364 --> 00:06:01,572
You tricked.

60
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:04,069
Oh, yeah,
I tricked you for sure.

61
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,203
Marionettes have
a fascinating history.

62
00:06:06,204 --> 00:06:09,372
The word's actually
a reference to the Virgin Mary.

63
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:16,885
Osa.

64
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:20,526
- Sorry about that.
- It's fine.

65
00:06:21,562 --> 00:06:22,693
This is Frodo.

66
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:24,860
Hi, Frodo.

67
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:30,536
Osa, turn around.

68
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:03,833
Hi!

69
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,487
- Just this?
- Just this.

70
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:50,676
How much do I owe you?

71
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,707
Hey. How much?

72
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,175
It's four dollars.

73
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:58,046
And you can't
have a cat in here.

74
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:00,950
It's a service cat.

75
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:05,118
No, I hear you.
I'll gather them all up

76
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:07,550
and get them on the bus
as soon as I can.

77
00:09:07,551 --> 00:09:09,189
Hello?

78
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,888
Hello? Shit!

79
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:12,587
You okay?

80
00:09:12,588 --> 00:09:14,468
Oh. Yeah. Um...

81
00:09:15,362 --> 00:09:17,560
Yeah, I just...
How's your pain?

82
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:20,936
- Three?
- Okay.

83
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:25,040
So, listen, uh,
we have to head back now.

84
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,304
Why?

85
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:27,713
Something's happening
in the city

86
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:29,264
and they want us back ASAP.

87
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:30,815
But we're
getting pizza first.

88
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:33,752
No, we're gonna have to
rain check the pizza.

89
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:35,347
They can wait,
it's just pizza.

90
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:38,119
Sam, we'll get pizza
another day, okay?

91
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,856
We're already in the city.

92
00:09:39,857 --> 00:09:41,721
Well, then we'll
order it tonight.

93
00:09:41,722 --> 00:09:43,585
- Just get it in the city.
- What?

94
00:09:43,586 --> 00:09:45,857
We're getting pizza in the city
and then we'll go back.

95
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:48,313
- No, we're not getting pizza.
- Yes, we are getting pizza.

96
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:50,769
- Okay, you got to calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

97
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,970
I don't want to argue with you.
I'm your friend, okay?

98
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:56,775
You're not my friend.
You're a nurse.

99
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:04,882
- I'm getting on the bus.
- Yeah, get on the bus.

100
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:11,658
I'm s...

101
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,401
Use that one.
Good leg goes up.

102
00:12:27,422 --> 00:12:28,454
Can you walk?

103
00:12:29,622 --> 00:12:31,721
I got you. I got you.

104
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:37,034
It was like
a flash and then...

105
00:12:47,677 --> 00:12:50,915
Ma'am! Ma'am!
Take cover! Now!

106
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,951
They're fucking everywhere!

107
00:13:20,946 --> 00:13:22,805
Run! Run!

108
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,252
Shh! Shh!

109
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,556
Shelter in place.

110
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:24,624
Remain silent.

111
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,526
Attackers are deadly.

112
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,979
Make no sound.

113
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,433
Wait for
further instructions.

114
00:18:25,514 --> 00:18:26,977
Attackers are deadly.

115
00:18:26,978 --> 00:18:29,253
Remain silent.

116
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:28,131
Minus 73.949708 west.

117
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:32,740
I repeat. Minus 73.949708 west.

118
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:35,061
Evacuate the area.

119
00:20:35,062 --> 00:20:36,578
- Sorry.
- I repeat.

120
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:40,077
Remain silent
and evacuate the area.

121
00:20:41,355 --> 00:20:45,291
This is not a drill.
Evacuate immediately.

122
00:20:46,052 --> 00:20:48,359
At 2100 hours,

123
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,121
all civilians
on Manhattan bridges

124
00:20:51,122 --> 00:20:52,727
will be in active...

125
00:22:27,383 --> 00:22:28,756
What's happening?

126
00:22:28,757 --> 00:22:31,496
We're trapped. We're trapped!

127
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,224
- We're all gonna die...
- Shh!

128
00:22:38,504 --> 00:22:40,433
Shh!

129
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,169
Shh!

130
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,677
Shh!

131
00:22:50,275 --> 00:22:52,517
Look what they're doing!
Look what they're doing!

132
00:22:52,518 --> 00:22:53,749
Stop.

133
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,600
Look what they're doing!

134
00:22:57,557 --> 00:22:59,477
We're all gonna die!

135
00:23:13,969 --> 00:23:15,474
I'm sorry.

136
00:24:40,055 --> 00:24:41,450
No.

137
00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:45,355
I'm going.

138
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:15,990
Stay. Stay.

139
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,227
Boat evacuations
are beginning now

140
00:30:52,228 --> 00:30:54,162
at the South Street Seaport.

141
00:30:54,163 --> 00:30:56,891
Travel south
with extreme caution.

142
00:30:56,892 --> 00:30:58,232
Come with me.

143
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:00,828
You have to be very quiet,
okay? Come on.

144
00:31:00,829 --> 00:31:04,569
This is
a mandatory evacuation order.

145
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,504
We remain under attack.

146
00:31:06,505 --> 00:31:11,180
Seek shelter on water.
The attackers cannot swim.

147
00:31:11,181 --> 00:31:13,182
Boat evacuations
are beginning now

148
00:31:13,183 --> 00:31:14,579
at the South Street Seaport.

149
00:34:06,918 --> 00:34:08,357
Go.

150
00:36:20,854 --> 00:36:23,326
Please! Please!

151
00:36:23,327 --> 00:36:25,725
- Please! Help me!
- Shh!

152
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:28,090
Help! Help me!

153
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:23,353
Jonathan? Jonathan!

154
00:41:02,399 --> 00:41:03,464
Hey.

155
00:41:06,337 --> 00:41:07,369
Hey.

156
00:41:10,506 --> 00:41:11,879
What's your name?

157
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:17,379
Talk under
the rain. What's your name?

158
00:41:25,026 --> 00:41:26,090
Eric.

159
00:41:26,091 --> 00:41:28,961
Eric? Okay, Eric.

160
00:41:28,962 --> 00:41:31,668
You need to go
to the South Street Seaport.

161
00:41:31,669 --> 00:41:33,329
There are boats there, okay?

162
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,397
Okay.

163
00:41:36,807 --> 00:41:39,005
Okay. Okay.

164
00:41:40,371 --> 00:41:41,579
- Eric?
- Okay.

165
00:41:42,241 --> 00:41:43,844
- Hey.
- Okay.

166
00:41:43,845 --> 00:41:46,914
You need to stop
following me, okay?

167
00:41:47,884 --> 00:41:48,916
Okay.

168
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,024
- That way?
- Yeah.

169
00:42:07,101 --> 00:42:08,133
Okay.

170
00:42:10,533 --> 00:42:11,774
Okay.

171
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,044
Okay. Okay. Okay.

172
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,279
I'm really scared.

173
00:42:25,482 --> 00:42:27,724
I don't want to die here.

174
00:42:35,558 --> 00:42:36,700
Okay.

175
00:42:37,131 --> 00:42:38,262
Look.

176
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:42,299
Let's just get out
of the rain, okay?

177
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,400
Okay.

178
00:42:45,678 --> 00:42:46,974
Okay.

179
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:49,405
Come on.

180
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:20,073
- Is this your place?
- Yeah.

181
00:43:22,638 --> 00:43:24,011
Kick it down.

182
00:43:26,983 --> 00:43:28,950
Kick it down with
your foot.

183
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,824
Wait.

184
00:44:26,911 --> 00:44:29,043
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for my meds.

185
00:44:32,411 --> 00:44:33,783
Why are you looking
for your meds?

186
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:35,951
Because every muscle
in my body is on fire!

187
00:44:38,747 --> 00:44:41,583
Eric,
do you have family here?

188
00:44:45,193 --> 00:44:46,455
Why?

189
00:44:46,456 --> 00:44:48,733
Don't you have
anywhere you can go?

190
00:44:52,629 --> 00:44:53,694
No.

191
00:44:59,812 --> 00:45:02,439
My parents are in Kent.

192
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,607
In England.

193
00:45:08,348 --> 00:45:10,612
I came here for law school.

194
00:45:15,091 --> 00:45:17,619
That was the one thing
I was supposed to do.

195
00:45:20,756 --> 00:45:23,801
You got to get to the water
and get out of the city.

196
00:45:26,366 --> 00:45:29,037
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to get pizza.

197
00:45:30,733 --> 00:45:31,874
Where?

198
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:34,108
Patsy's up in Harlem.

199
00:45:38,411 --> 00:45:40,428
I think the world
might be ending.

200
00:45:40,429 --> 00:45:42,445
And I think there's
a slice of Patsy's

201
00:45:42,446 --> 00:45:45,449
sitting up there that's
the last that'll ever exist.

202
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:46,549
And I'm gonna get it.

203
00:45:54,394 --> 00:45:55,755
Okay.

204
00:45:55,756 --> 00:45:57,163
Okay, what?

205
00:45:57,164 --> 00:45:59,363
Okay, let's get pizza.

206
00:45:59,364 --> 00:46:01,563
No, I'm getting pizza.

207
00:46:01,564 --> 00:46:03,808
- Did you write this?
- Yeah.

208
00:46:05,768 --> 00:46:07,290
You're a poet?

209
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:08,813
Not anymore.

210
00:46:09,607 --> 00:46:10,980
Who's that?

211
00:46:13,985 --> 00:46:15,815
That's my dad.

212
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:17,645
He played piano?

213
00:46:17,646 --> 00:46:19,516
He played
beautiful piano.

214
00:46:24,853 --> 00:46:27,095
This wasn't part
of the plan.

215
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,982
Please, can I come
and get pizza with you?

216
00:47:05,168 --> 00:47:06,332
Read this.

217
00:47:11,801 --> 00:47:13,339
"Bad Math.'

218
00:47:15,178 --> 00:47:17,541
You said one to two years.

219
00:47:18,412 --> 00:47:20,280
And it has been two.

220
00:47:21,514 --> 00:47:26,748
You said four to six months,
And it has been six.

221
00:47:26,749 --> 00:47:30,389
And Mrs. Friedlander taught
Me subtraction,

222
00:47:31,656 --> 00:47:34,822
And the corner store
Taught me addition,

223
00:47:35,968 --> 00:47:41,136
And I used only simple maths
All my life.

224
00:47:46,407 --> 00:47:48,605
And I never needed more
Than more,

225
00:47:49,311 --> 00:47:50,706
And less.

226
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,182
To four.
To three.

227
00:47:54,877 --> 00:47:58,351
To smaller
And smaller.

228
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:03,455
Until months,

229
00:48:04,623 --> 00:48:06,029
To days.

230
00:48:07,725 --> 00:48:09,263
To hours,

231
00:48:13,731 --> 00:48:15,104
To seconds.

232
00:48:20,771 --> 00:48:22,474
But to not now.'"

233
00:57:17,613 --> 00:57:19,274
You're good. You're good.

234
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,492
Hey...

235
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:31,726
It's okay. It's okay.

236
00:57:31,727 --> 00:57:33,188
It's okay?

237
00:57:33,189 --> 00:57:35,961
It's okay. It's okay.

238
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,265
It's okay.

239
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:44,871
It's okay.

240
00:57:49,042 --> 00:57:51,779
It's okay. It's okay.
It's fine.

241
01:03:44,628 --> 01:03:45,869
No, no, no.

242
01:09:17,466 --> 01:09:19,158
I'm here.

243
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:21,666
I'm here.

244
01:09:32,811 --> 01:09:35,911
My father
played beautiful piano.

245
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:41,587
I loved...

246
01:09:44,691 --> 01:09:47,692
when he took me
to see him play.

247
01:09:48,497 --> 01:09:50,398
At a jazz club

248
01:09:51,225 --> 01:09:53,159
by Patsy's.

249
01:09:54,228 --> 01:09:56,866
Then after,
we'd get pizza.

250
01:10:00,872 --> 01:10:02,201
Pizza.

251
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,255
What happened to him?

252
01:10:18,428 --> 01:10:20,120
He died.

253
01:10:24,192 --> 01:10:26,401
Like I am now.

254
01:10:43,552 --> 01:10:46,080
Not before we get pizza.

255
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:55,254
Not before we get pizza.

256
01:13:26,779 --> 01:13:28,781
Where did
your dad play piano?

257
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:56,051
Breathe.

258
01:23:38,392 --> 01:23:39,424
Run.

259
01:24:08,587 --> 01:24:10,653
Stop the boat.
Stop the boat!

260
01:25:22,562 --> 01:25:24,364
You can do it! Come on!

261
01:26:22,358 --> 01:26:23,753
You're safe.

262
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:29,187
Safe.

263
01:27:41,668 --> 01:27:42,898
Eric,

264
01:27:44,473 --> 01:27:46,935
you better take care of my cat.

265
01:27:48,301 --> 01:27:51,511
Don't rub his belly.
He doesn't like that.

266
01:27:53,108 --> 01:27:56,274
And don't feed him too much.
He'll get fat.

267
01:27:58,982 --> 01:28:00,619
And thank you.

268
01:28:01,754 --> 01:28:04,018
Thank you for bringing me home.

269
01:28:05,186 --> 01:28:07,989
Thank you for helping me
live again.

270
01:28:09,058 --> 01:28:11,696
I had forgotten
how the city sings.

271
01:28:12,732 --> 01:28:15,502
