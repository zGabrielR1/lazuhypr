1
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:33,880
<i>I</i> used to think

2
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:36,611
<i>this was the beginning of your story.</i>

3
00:01:43,447 --> 00:01:45,723
<i>Memory is a strange thing.</i>

4
00:01:47,117 --> 00:01:50,189
<i>It doesn't work like I thought it did.</i>

5
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:55,066
<i>We are so bound by time, by its order.</i>

6
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:17,487
Okay.

7
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:26,224
Okay. Come back to me.

8
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:28,030
Come back to me.

9
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,002
Come back to me.

10
00:02:31,094 --> 00:02:32,664
Stick 'em up!

11
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:37,342
Are you the sheriff
in this here town?

12
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:40,610
These are my tickle guns,
and I'm gonna getcha!

13
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:42,274
No!

14
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:45,945
You want me to chase you?
You better run!

15
00:02:47,844 --> 00:02:50,415
- Ah!
- Oh!

16
00:03:05,195 --> 00:03:07,607
<i>I remember
moments in the middle.</i>

17
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:12,644
I love you.

18
00:03:13,537 --> 00:03:14,880
I hate you!

19
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,893
<i>And this was the end.</i>

20
00:03:28,986 --> 00:03:31,432
Shhh...

21
00:03:37,394 --> 00:03:39,738
Come back to me.

22
00:03:39,796 --> 00:03:41,571
You come back to me.

23
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,423
<i>But now I'm not so sure</i>

24
00:03:58,482 --> 00:04:00,655
<i>I believe in beginnings and endings.</i>

25
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:05,829
<i>There are days that define
your story beyond your life.</i>

26
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,500
<i>Like the day they arrived.</i>

27
00:04:21,104 --> 00:04:22,105
Good morning.

28
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:23,206
Morning.

29
00:04:26,777 --> 00:04:28,779
Where is everyone?

30
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,453
Okay. Well, let's get started.

31
00:04:32,549 --> 00:04:35,359
Today we are talking about Portuguese

32
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:37,454
and why it sounds so different

33
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:39,864
from the other Romance languages.

34
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:44,302
The story of Portuguese begins
in the kingdom of Galicia...

35
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:49,637
Sorry.
In the Middle Ages,

36
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,307
where language was seen
as an expression of art.

37
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,654
Any news you want to share?

38
00:05:02,713 --> 00:05:06,058
Dr. Banks, can you turn
the TV to a news channel?

39
00:05:22,332 --> 00:05:25,404
<i>But police have
already set up a blockade</i>

40
00:05:25,502 --> 00:05:26,742
<i>here around the area.</i>

41
00:05:26,837 --> 00:05:30,182
<i>As you can see,
we've got just about as close as we can,</i>

42
00:05:30,273 --> 00:05:31,513
<i>but unfortunately,</i>

43
00:05:31,608 --> 00:05:33,918
<i>Montana right now
is on complete lockdown.</i>

44
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,082
<i>The object apparently
touched down 40 minutes ago,</i>

45
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,023
<i>just north of I-94.</i>

46
00:05:39,082 --> 00:05:41,528
<i>We're wailing to hear if this is perhaps</i>

47
00:05:41,585 --> 00:05:44,259
<i>an experimental vessel</i> or...

48
00:05:44,354 --> 00:05:46,425
Hold on, it...

49
00:05:46,523 --> 00:05:50,198
<i>I'm learning that more objects
like this have landed in</i>

50
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:52,534
<i>as many as eight other locations</i>

51
00:05:52,596 --> 00:05:54,598
<i>around the world.</i>

52
00:05:54,698 --> 00:05:56,439
<i>Yes, can we?</i>

53
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:59,776
<i>This is from a site in Hokkaido.</i>

54
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,443
<i>This is worldwide.
It is happening right now.</i>

55
00:06:09,446 --> 00:06:11,323
Okay. Um...

56
00:06:12,482 --> 00:06:14,291
I'm sorry. Class is dismissed.

57
00:06:54,758 --> 00:06:57,432
You are an idiot!
You drove right into me!

58
00:06:59,095 --> 00:07:02,008
You just ruined my car!

59
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:04,840
<i>For now, we're simply
asking for cooperation</i>

60
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:07,006
<i>while authorities assess the object.</i>

61
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:09,276
<i>So, you're saying it's not ours?</i>

62
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:11,114
<i>Do you even know if it's from Earth?</i>

63
00:07:11,174 --> 00:07:12,585
We're still collecting information.

64
00:07:12,609 --> 00:07:13,920
<i>We're coordinating with other countries.</i>

65
00:07:13,944 --> 00:07:15,787
<i>We're not the only ones to</i>

66
00:07:15,846 --> 00:07:18,019
<i>have one of these in our backyard.</i>

67
00:07:18,114 --> 00:07:21,118
<i>If this is
some son' of peaceful first contact,</i>

68
00:07:21,218 --> 00:07:22,788
<i>why send 12?</i>

69
00:07:22,886 --> 00:07:24,559
<i>Why not just one?</i>

70
00:07:34,898 --> 00:07:37,310
Yeah, I know. I saw that, too.

71
00:07:40,303 --> 00:07:42,249
Uh-huh.

72
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:49,153
Uh-huh. I don't know, Mom.

73
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:51,886
I'm watching
the same news coverage you are.

74
00:07:54,885 --> 00:07:58,992
Well, Mom,
please don't bother with that channel.

75
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:02,935
How many times do I have to tell you?
Those people are idiots.

76
00:08:05,328 --> 00:08:07,501
Yeah, well, do I sound nervous?

77
00:08:08,498 --> 00:08:10,341
Okay. Exactly. So...

78
00:08:11,668 --> 00:08:14,080
Um, me? Yeah, um, you know me.

79
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,013
I'm about the same.

80
00:08:20,076 --> 00:08:22,181
Mom, I'm fine.

81
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:25,853
Okay, I'll call you later. Bye.

82
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:37,432
<i>And around eight
hours after landing,</i>

83
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:39,405
<i>there are still no signs
of what might be called</i>

84
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,874
<i>"first contact'</i>

85
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:44,777
<i>Now, the objects measure
at least 1,500 feet tall...</i>

86
00:08:44,868 --> 00:08:47,439
<i>Two are reported
to have penetrated Russian airspace.</i>

87
00:08:47,537 --> 00:08:50,950
<i>One in Siberia, and the other
off the coast of the Black...</i>

88
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,714
<i>"above the ocean.</i>

89
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:55,221
<i>So far, there are 12 unidentified objects</i>

90
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:56,621
<i>spread across the globe.</i>

91
00:08:56,713 --> 00:08:59,284
<i>There is no obvious logic
to their locations</i>

92
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:02,056
<i>and no evidence that
the ships are even occu...</i>

93
00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:05,622
<i>entertain the idea that
If it is a kind of vessel,</i>

94
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:08,134
<i>it may be unmanned.</i>

95
00:09:08,224 --> 00:09:11,228
<i>Regardless, we have
a protocol for scenarios like this.</i>

96
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:21,973
<i>After Tuesday's
extraordinary events,</i>

97
00:10:22,032 --> 00:10:25,036
<i>the President this morning has
declared a state of emergency,</i>

98
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:26,910
<i>with as many as 5,000 National Guard</i>

99
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:29,210
<i>being deployed to
the state of Montana alone.</i>

100
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:31,808
<i>Borders are closed
and flights have been grounded,</i>

101
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,684
<i>stranding millions of travelers.</i>

102
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,154
<i>Panic buying of gas, water and food</i>

103
00:10:36,212 --> 00:10:37,987
<i>continues to escalate,</i>

104
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:39,859
<i>and federal authorities
have temporarily lifted</i>

105
00:10:39,883 --> 00:10:42,864
<i>all caps on overtime
for law enforcement.</i>

106
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:45,830
<i>The ATF has put a temporary ban
on new gun licenses,</i>

107
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:47,926
<i>forcing many independent suppliers of</i>

108
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:50,026
<i>hunting equipment and firearms</i>

109
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,037
<i>to close their doors to the public.</i>

110
00:10:52,162 --> 00:10:54,438
<i>Forty-eight hours later
and no further development...</i>

111
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:55,737
Two days...

112
00:10:55,832 --> 00:10:57,573
<i>from the site of the 12 UFOs.</i>

113
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,271
And already, the public expects us

114
00:10:59,369 --> 00:11:01,212
to know the answers.

115
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:03,248
I'm Colonel G.T. Weber.

116
00:11:05,075 --> 00:11:06,179
We never formally met,

117
00:11:06,242 --> 00:11:08,020
but two years ago,
you did some Farsi translations

118
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:09,455
for Army Intelligence.

119
00:11:09,546 --> 00:11:10,684
Oh.

120
00:11:10,747 --> 00:11:13,387
You made quick work
of those insurgent videos.

121
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:15,689
You made quick work
of those insurgents.

122
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:20,934
You are on the top of everyone's list

123
00:11:21,024 --> 00:11:23,368
when it comes to translations.

124
00:11:23,426 --> 00:11:27,135
And you have another
two years in your SSBI,

125
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,301
so you still have lop-secret clearance.

126
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:32,710
That's why I'm in your office
and not at Berkeley.

127
00:11:33,703 --> 00:11:35,273
<i>Okay.-</i>

128
00:11:43,546 --> 00:11:46,049
I have something I need you
to translate for me.

129
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,233
<i>Why are you here?</i>

130
00:11:59,295 --> 00:12:01,901
<i>Can you... Can you understand us?</i>

131
00:12:09,272 --> 00:12:10,774
<i>Where did you come from?</i>

132
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:23,295
Now you heard it.
What do you make of it?

133
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:28,193
Is that...

134
00:12:28,324 --> 00:12:29,928
Yes.

135
00:12:32,095 --> 00:12:33,870
How many?

136
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:38,810
- How many what?
- Um, how many, um, speaking?

137
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:43,440
Two.

138
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:48,286
Assume they were not speaking
at the same time.

139
00:12:48,344 --> 00:12:51,484
Are you sure? Did they have mouths...

140
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:54,993
How would you approach
translating this'?

141
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:58,992
Do you hear any words? Phrases?

142
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,130
I don't... I don't know.

143
00:13:04,194 --> 00:13:05,901
So what can you tell me?

144
00:13:05,995 --> 00:13:08,202
I can tell you that it's impossible

145
00:13:08,298 --> 00:13:10,244
to translate from an audio file.

146
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,405
I would need to be there,
to interact with them.

147
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:16,484
You didn't need that
with the Farsi translations.

148
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:19,349
I didn't need it because
I already knew the language,

149
00:13:19,475 --> 00:13:21,546
but this... This is... Ah...

150
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:25,819
I know what you're doing.

151
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:28,828
- Tell me what I'm doing.
- I'm not taking you to Montana.

152
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:30,963
It's all I can do
to keep it from turning into a tourist site

153
00:13:30,987 --> 00:13:32,298
for everybody who has a TS clearance.

154
00:13:32,322 --> 00:13:34,324
I'm just telling you what it would take

155
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,835
to do this job.

156
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:37,337
This is not a negotiation.

157
00:13:37,493 --> 00:13:41,100
If I leave here, your chance is gone.

158
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:50,847
Good day.

159
00:13:50,907 --> 00:13:52,716
Colonel?

160
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,887
You mentioned Berkeley.

161
00:13:56,012 --> 00:13:58,288
Are you going to ask Danvers next?

162
00:13:58,381 --> 00:13:59,689
Maybe.

163
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:02,195
Before you commit to him,

164
00:14:02,252 --> 00:14:05,893
ask him the Sanskrit word
for war and its translation.

165
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,237
<i>An agreement on sharing
scientific discoveries</i>

166
00:14:16,366 --> 00:14:17,936
<i>looks closer tonight,</i>

167
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:20,640
<i>as Russia and China join talks
at the United Nations.</i>

168
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:24,207
<i>Meanwhile, financial markets
across the world are in crisis</i>

169
00:14:24,274 --> 00:14:26,447
<i>as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell</i>

170
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:28,112
over 2, 000 points...

171
00:14:45,895 --> 00:14:46,896
Morning.

172
00:14:47,063 --> 00:14:48,064
Colonel?

173
00:14:48,798 --> 00:14:50,243
<i>Gavisti.</i>

174
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,246
He says it means "an argument."

175
00:14:52,302 --> 00:14:53,804
What do you say it means?

176
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,438
A desire for more cows.

177
00:14:55,571 --> 00:14:57,073
Pack your bags.

178
00:14:58,608 --> 00:15:01,646
- All right. Give me 20 minutes'?
- Takeoff in ten.

179
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:04,592
Dr. Banks.
Right this way, please.

180
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:22,333
<i>Contact and ready to approach...</i>

181
00:15:22,432 --> 00:15:24,935
Excuse me, Dr. Banks, let me make
sure you're properly secured.

182
00:15:33,176 --> 00:15:34,450
You okay?

183
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:18,495
<i>Sorry, I couldn't hear
what you were saying.</i>

184
00:16:18,554 --> 00:16:21,501
<i>Language is the foundation
of civilization.</i>

185
00:16:21,557 --> 00:16:23,935
<i>It is the glue
that holds a people together.</i>

186
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,870
<i>"R is me first weapon drawn
in a conflict"</i>

187
00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:31,611
<i>Louise, this is Ian Donnelly.
Louise Banks, Ian Donnelly.</i>

188
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:33,203
<i>That's quite</i> a <i>greeting.</i>

189
00:16:33,336 --> 00:16:35,213
<i>Yeah, well, you wrote it.</i>

190
00:16:35,338 --> 00:16:36,874
<i>Yeah.</i>

191
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:39,418
<i>It's the kind of thing
you write as a preface.</i>

192
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:41,546
<i>Dazzle them with the basics.</i>

193
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:44,715
<i>Yeah, it's great. Even if it's wrung.</i>

194
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:47,088
<i>It's wrong?</i>

195
00:16:47,183 --> 00:16:49,459
<i>Well, the cornerstone of civilization
isn't language,</i>

196
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:51,031
<i>it's science.</i>

197
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:54,695
<i>Ian is a theoretical physicist
from Los Alamos.</i>

198
00:16:55,758 --> 00:16:57,870
<i>You'll be reporting to me,
but you'll be working with him</i>

199
00:16:57,894 --> 00:16:59,373
<i>when you're in the sheik.</i>

200
00:16:59,695 --> 00:17:01,538
<i>That's what they're calling the UFO.</i>

201
00:17:01,697 --> 00:17:05,076
<i>What do they wan!
And where are they from?</i>

202
00:17:05,435 --> 00:17:07,642
<i>And beyond that, how did they get here?</i>

203
00:17:07,737 --> 00:17:10,274
<i>Are they capable of
faster-than-fight travel?</i>

204
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:13,877
<i>We prepared
a list of questions to go over,</i>

205
00:17:13,943 --> 00:17:17,117
<i>starting with a series of
"handshake" binary sequences...</i>

206
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:18,749
<i>How about we just talk to them</i>

207
00:17:18,881 --> 00:17:21,225
<i>before we start throwing
math problems at them?</i>

208
00:17:23,553 --> 00:17:25,590
<i>This is why you're both here.</i>

209
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,228
<i>I'll bring the coffee.</i>

210
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:33,304
<i>Coffee with some aliens.</i>

211
00:19:43,192 --> 00:19:45,900
I want you to take
these two to Dr. Kettler.

212
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:47,769
YES, sir.

213
00:19:47,863 --> 00:19:49,399
Follow the captain to medical.

214
00:19:49,532 --> 00:19:51,205
It should take just a few minutes,

215
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:53,372
and then we'll get started.

216
00:20:04,046 --> 00:20:07,721
We'll take care of your bag.
I'll lake your cell phones.

217
00:20:07,783 --> 00:20:09,660
Cell phones!

218
00:20:10,886 --> 00:20:12,729
Follow me.

219
00:20:12,788 --> 00:20:15,564
Put these on. You're gonna
wear them at all times.

220
00:20:28,404 --> 00:20:29,849
Sir, they're here.

221
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,415
Louise Banks?
Ian Donnelly?

222
00:20:32,908 --> 00:20:34,386
When was the last time
either of you have eaten?

223
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,753
- Last night.
- Same.

224
00:20:35,811 --> 00:20:37,656
Last time
you did something stressful?

225
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,421
Does now count?

226
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,259
Just saying...

227
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:45,094
Uh, who was being carted off
in the medevac?

228
00:20:45,187 --> 00:20:48,657
Not everyone is able to
process experiences like this.

229
00:20:48,758 --> 00:20:50,669
I'm gonna get some blood from you

230
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,330
and give you an immunization dose

231
00:20:52,428 --> 00:20:54,601
that covers a battery of bacterial threats.

232
00:20:54,697 --> 00:20:57,769
Could you sign these, please?
And roll up your sleeves.

233
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:59,278
Either of you claustrophobic?

234
00:20:59,335 --> 00:21:00,780
- No.
- No.

235
00:21:00,836 --> 00:21:03,339
Currently taking any medications?
Allergies?

236
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:04,941
Pregnant?

237
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:06,452
No.

238
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:08,613
The booster is a kick to your system,

239
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:10,850
so you may experience
some side effects,

240
00:21:10,946 --> 00:21:12,516
nausea, dizziness, headaches,

241
00:21:12,615 --> 00:21:15,289
a ringing in your ears,
like you have tinnitus.

242
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:17,353
They wouldn't go, either way.

243
00:21:26,796 --> 00:21:28,639
You see what's happening to him?

244
00:21:28,698 --> 00:21:30,143
How does this even work?

245
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:31,343
The readings do not change,

246
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:32,539
<i>but I don't know,</i>

247
00:21:32,635 --> 00:21:34,876
<i>it's like we're insects
on a piece of paper,</i>

248
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,041
<i>and they're easing us out of the house.</i>

249
00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:39,881
<i>A1 exactly 112 minutes and 19 seconds,</i>

250
00:21:39,975 --> 00:21:43,218
<i>gravity starts to shift
and slides us out of the room.</i>

251
00:21:43,312 --> 00:21:46,384
Have you found
a scientific explanation for it?

252
00:21:46,482 --> 00:21:47,893
Like, is it for them?

253
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:49,894
<i>Uh, no. We think it's for us.</i>

254
00:21:49,985 --> 00:21:52,659
<i>Air doesn't seem to circulate
inside the chamber,</i>

255
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:55,395
<i>so after about two hours,
we run out of oxygen.</i>

256
00:21:55,491 --> 00:21:59,064
It doesn't take 18 hours
to pump fresh air into a room.

257
00:21:59,161 --> 00:22:00,663
Atmosphere...

258
00:22:02,331 --> 00:22:03,833
Excuse me?

259
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:06,004
If their atmosphere is
different from Earth,

260
00:22:06,102 --> 00:22:07,513
it would certainly take hours

261
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,846
to rebalance their O2 content
and pressure for us

262
00:22:09,905 --> 00:22:11,851
every time they open their door.

263
00:22:11,907 --> 00:22:14,353
So, they could suffocate us
if they wanted.

264
00:22:14,443 --> 00:22:16,252
This is Agent Halpern
with the CIA.

265
00:22:16,345 --> 00:22:18,689
Let me get you two to your stations.

266
00:22:18,748 --> 00:22:20,022
Yes, sir.

267
00:22:20,116 --> 00:22:22,858
Remember, we need answers
as soon as possible.

268
00:22:22,918 --> 00:22:24,693
What do they want?
Where are they from?

269
00:22:24,754 --> 00:22:26,097
Why are they here?

270
00:22:26,188 --> 00:22:27,428
This is the priority.

271
00:22:27,523 --> 00:22:29,434
Everyone, this is Dr. Ian Donnelly.

272
00:22:29,525 --> 00:22:31,198
He'll be running this team here.

273
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,365
Have they responded to anything?

274
00:22:33,462 --> 00:22:36,033
Shapes, patterns, numbers, Fibonacci?

275
00:22:36,132 --> 00:22:37,409
We can't tell what they're saying

276
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:39,379
when they respond to "hello," so...

277
00:22:40,202 --> 00:22:42,113
Don't get ahead of yourself.

278
00:22:44,373 --> 00:22:45,943
What have you figured out?

279
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:49,079
We're just getting started.
Good morning!

280
00:22:49,145 --> 00:22:52,092
This is Dr. Louise Banks.
She'll be heading your team.

281
00:22:52,148 --> 00:22:53,593
It's a pleasure meeting you.

282
00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:56,255
Dr. Banks is
taking over the mission from Dr. Walker.

283
00:22:57,887 --> 00:23:00,299
That's a 15-minute warning.

284
00:23:00,389 --> 00:23:02,300
You scuba-dive before?

285
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:07,764
What kind of radiation exposure
are we walking into?

286
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,140
Nominal. These are just for safety.

287
00:23:10,232 --> 00:23:12,906
So, is there any physical
contact with the, um...

288
00:23:12,968 --> 00:23:15,676
Am I the only one having
trouble saying "aliens"?

289
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:17,648
There's a wall. Like, a glass wall.

290
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,413
You can't get to them.

291
00:23:20,743 --> 00:23:23,451
So, what do they look like?

292
00:23:23,512 --> 00:23:25,651
You'll see soon enough. Hurry up.

293
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:47,208
The <i>suits</i> are clumsy at <i>first,</i>

294
00:23:47,303 --> 00:23:49,340
<i>but you get used to them.</i>

295
00:23:50,873 --> 00:23:52,716
<i>I'll open a second vehicle.</i>

296
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:02,158
<i>We'll be there in a few minutes.</i>

297
00:24:02,218 --> 00:24:04,323
<i>Make sure you hold on to something.</i>

298
00:25:00,576 --> 00:25:04,114
Copy, Condor.
We <i>will</i> observe, but not initiate. Over.

299
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:06,355
Watch your step.

300
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:09,363
<i>We'll keep
Alpha channel open. Over.</i>

301
00:25:09,418 --> 00:25:11,955
<i>Alpha, be advised.
Humidity increased since yesterday.</i>

302
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:14,056
<i>Every 18 hours,</i>

303
00:25:14,123 --> 00:25:16,364
<i>the door opens up at the bottom.</i>

304
00:25:18,861 --> 00:25:20,602
<i>That's where we go in.</i>

305
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:33,076
<i>Zero movement.
Alpha detail, clear to proceed. Over.</i>

306
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:34,452
Copy, Condor.

307
00:25:34,476 --> 00:25:36,387
<i>Beginning our ascent now. Over.</i>

308
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,791
Ten feet.

309
00:25:47,489 --> 00:25:49,298
<i>Five</i> feet.

310
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:52,969
<i>Two, one...</i>

311
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:13,159
<i>Alpha clear to enter antechamber.</i>

312
00:26:21,857 --> 00:26:23,768
<i>Moving into position.</i>

313
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:35,376
<i>Thirty feel from target.</i>

314
00:26:35,471 --> 00:26:37,280
<i>Suit telemetry now full strength,</i>

315
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:38,977
<i>despite unknown interference.</i>

316
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:49,789
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

317
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,880
<i>20.3%.</i>

318
00:27:13,976 --> 00:27:16,547
<i>No known contaminates. Over.</i>

319
00:27:29,324 --> 00:27:31,429
<i>Radio signals are decreasing.</i>

320
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:34,531
90%, 85%..

321
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:55,119
Yeah, that just happened.

322
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:16,712
<i>All right, let's move!</i>

323
00:28:16,772 --> 00:28:17,910
<i>Time is wasting.</i>

324
00:28:18,774 --> 00:28:21,118
<i>You ready? You ready?</i>

325
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,623
<i>Let's do it!</i>

326
00:28:23,712 --> 00:28:27,091
<i>Condor, I'm proceeding first
with Captain Marks, over.</i>

327
00:28:33,889 --> 00:28:36,927
<i>Gravity nominal
in the antechamber. Over!</i>

328
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,131
It's all good, sir.

329
00:28:39,228 --> 00:28:40,639
<i>You can proceed.</i>

330
00:28:40,729 --> 00:28:43,471
<i>Stand by! Okay, bring ii up.</i>

331
00:28:48,737 --> 00:28:50,341
<i>Vitals are low.</i>

332
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:53,283
<i>Radio signal strength
stable at 75%. Over.</i>

333
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,787
You okay?

334
00:28:59,348 --> 00:29:00,759
Yeah.

335
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,488
Dr. Banks?

336
00:29:07,356 --> 00:29:10,428
<i>You can do this. Come on.</i>

337
00:29:10,492 --> 00:29:12,267
<i>I</i> don't <i>know.</i> I... <i>I</i> think...

338
00:29:21,003 --> 00:29:22,641
<i>Grab her.</i>

339
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,052
<i>Donnelly, are you all right?</i>

340
00:29:38,387 --> 00:29:40,389
Dr. Donnelly, you good?

341
00:29:42,057 --> 00:29:44,333
<i>Dr. Donnelly,
are you all right?</i>

342
00:29:44,393 --> 00:29:46,373
<i>Please respond. Over.</i>

343
00:29:46,461 --> 00:29:48,065
Yeah.

344
00:29:51,066 --> 00:29:53,068
<i>Holy fuck!</i>

345
00:29:57,906 --> 00:29:59,214
<i>We're gonna go down there,</i>

346
00:29:59,308 --> 00:30:02,050
<i>and you're gonna start your job.</i>

347
00:30:02,144 --> 00:30:03,851
- Okay.
- Okay?

348
00:30:03,912 --> 00:30:05,016
<i>Okay-</i>

349
00:30:05,147 --> 00:30:06,251
<i>Everybody, move out!</i>

350
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:08,059
<i>Alpha detail is in position.</i>

351
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,687
<i>Team is in position.</i>

352
00:30:09,751 --> 00:30:11,253
<i>We're on the move.</i>

353
00:30:56,965 --> 00:30:59,138
Condor, Alpha's now in the nave.

354
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:01,912
<i>Setting up equipment
and telemetry. Over.</i>

355
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:37,516
So, what happens now'?

356
00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:41,947
They arrive.

357
00:32:45,707 --> 00:32:47,243
<i>Dr. Banks?</i>

358
00:32:52,314 --> 00:32:54,385
Dr. Banks?

359
00:32:55,484 --> 00:32:57,225
You can start.

360
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:03,866
<i>In airlock.</i>

361
00:33:03,925 --> 00:33:06,599
<i>Do not stop until you have
passed the airlock door.</i>

362
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:08,697
<i>Do noi attempt to remove hazmat suits</i>

363
00:33:08,764 --> 00:33:11,677
<i>without assistance
from authorized personnel.</i>

364
00:33:11,733 --> 00:33:13,235
<i>Hazmat suits</i>

365
00:33:13,335 --> 00:33:16,248
<i>without assistance
from authorized personnel.</i>

366
00:33:16,338 --> 00:33:18,181
Wait. Just a minute. Just a minute.

367
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:32,020
Clear.

368
00:33:32,087 --> 00:33:33,647
- All right.
- Step on out, please.

369
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:34,790
Now hold that.

370
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:39,531
Am I fired?

371
00:33:39,928 --> 00:33:42,306
You're better than the last guy.

372
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:44,934
That doesn't
make me feel any better.

373
00:33:46,535 --> 00:33:49,641
You both have till 02:00 hours
to figure something out.

374
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:52,150
Okay. What happens then?

375
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,913
You go back in.

376
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:29,948
<i>Violence continues to spread</i>

377
00:34:30,011 --> 00:34:32,855
<i>across the US today in
the wake of the 12 landings.</i>

378
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:34,256
<i>The president has declared</i>

379
00:34:34,316 --> 00:34:35,989
<i>a mandatory dusk-to-dawn curfew</i>

380
00:34:36,084 --> 00:34:38,462
<i>after the crackdown
by the National Guard Miler!</i>

381
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,296
<i>To prevent</i> a <i>third night of
footing across the country.</i>

382
00:34:41,356 --> 00:34:44,337
<i>In North Dakota, 144 members of</i>

383
00:34:44,426 --> 00:34:46,133
<i>the Saint Lawrence Pentecostal Cult</i>

384
00:34:46,194 --> 00:34:49,141
<i>are feared dead after they set
their compound ablaze.</i>

385
00:34:49,197 --> 00:34:51,643
<i>Their website claims
the arrival of the aliens</i>

386
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,373
<i>set in motion</i> a <i>prophesy that...</i>

387
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:16,325
Uh, we're up in 15.
You got any new intel?

388
00:35:16,391 --> 00:35:20,396
<i>Yeah, we've been playing back
some of their sounds.</i>

389
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:22,133
Where does that get you?

390
00:35:22,197 --> 00:35:23,870
<i>Well, they play audio back at us,</i>

391
00:35:23,965 --> 00:35:26,070
<i>from an unseen source.</i>

392
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,669
Audio of what?

393
00:35:27,736 --> 00:35:29,977
<i>Uh, it's bits of conversation
from the room.</i>

394
00:35:30,038 --> 00:35:31,915
<i>Random clips of dialogue.</i>

395
00:35:32,807 --> 00:35:35,253
<i>Really, we have nothing;.</i>

396
00:35:37,746 --> 00:35:40,090
<i>T-minus 14 minutes
to shell access.</i>

397
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:42,161
<i>T-minus 14 minutes to shell access.</i>

398
00:36:04,406 --> 00:36:07,182
<i>T-minus 9 minutes to shell access.</i>

399
00:36:07,242 --> 00:36:10,246
<i>T-minus 9 minutes to shell access.</i>

400
00:36:10,345 --> 00:36:11,847
<i>What's that for?</i>

401
00:36:11,913 --> 00:36:13,859
<i>A visual aid.</i>

402
00:36:13,915 --> 00:36:16,589
<i>Look, I'm never
gonna be able to speak their words,</i>

403
00:36:16,685 --> 00:36:18,255
<i>if they are talking,</i>

404
00:36:18,353 --> 00:36:21,197
<i>but they might
have some sort of written language</i>

405
00:36:21,256 --> 00:36:23,202
<i>or basis for visual communication.</i>

406
00:36:23,258 --> 00:36:25,704
<i>Okay. Let's get started.</i>

407
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,144
<i>Human.</i>

408
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,502
<i>"Human."</i>

409
00:37:09,804 --> 00:37:13,752
<i>I'm human. What ave you?</i>

410
00:37:25,086 --> 00:37:26,656
<i>Human.</i>

411
00:38:16,971 --> 00:38:18,143
<i>Oh my God!</i>

412
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:19,377
<i>Are you getting this?</i>

413
00:38:19,474 --> 00:38:21,886
<i>Yes, sir!
It's uploading back is base camp.</i>

414
00:38:23,378 --> 00:38:26,655
<i>Louise, that's incredible.</i>

415
00:38:40,995 --> 00:38:42,997
<i>Human.</i>

416
00:38:44,165 --> 00:38:48,113
<i>Human.</i>

417
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,527
<i>Okay, slow down now.</i>

418
00:39:03,518 --> 00:39:04,861
Slow down.

419
00:39:22,103 --> 00:39:24,379
<i>I don't wanna take away
from your success in there,</i>

420
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:26,919
<i>but Dr. Banks,
is this really the right approach?</i>

421
00:39:26,975 --> 00:39:30,252
<i>Trying to teach them
how to speak and read?</i>

422
00:39:30,311 --> 00:39:32,120
<i>That's gotta take longer.</i>

423
00:39:32,213 --> 00:39:35,490
<i>You're wrong. It's faster.</i>

424
00:39:37,552 --> 00:39:41,500
Everything you do in there,
I have to explain to a room full of men

425
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:43,432
whose first and last question is...

426
00:39:43,491 --> 00:39:45,562
"How can this be used against us?"

427
00:39:45,627 --> 00:39:48,335
So you're gonna have to
give me more than that.

428
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:51,402
Kangaroo.

429
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:53,741
What is that?

430
00:39:53,802 --> 00:39:55,304
In 1770,

431
00:39:55,403 --> 00:39:57,178
Captain James Cook's ship ran aground

432
00:39:57,272 --> 00:39:58,580
off the coast of Australia,

433
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,415
and he led a party into the country,

434
00:40:00,475 --> 00:40:02,113
and they met the Aboriginal people.

435
00:40:02,177 --> 00:40:03,679
One of the sailors pointed at

436
00:40:03,778 --> 00:40:05,519
the animals that hop around

437
00:40:05,613 --> 00:40:07,320
and put their babies in their pouch,

438
00:40:07,415 --> 00:40:09,088
and he asked what they were,

439
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,289
and the Aborigine said, "Kangaroo."

440
00:40:13,087 --> 00:40:14,361
And the point is'?

441
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:16,233
It Wasn't till later
that they learned that

442
00:40:16,257 --> 00:40:18,999
"kangaroo" means
"I don't understand." So,

443
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,173
I need this so that we don't
misinterpret things in there.

444
00:40:22,263 --> 00:40:24,800
Otherwise, this is gonna
take 10 times as long.

445
00:40:26,768 --> 00:40:27,974
I can sell that for now.

446
00:40:29,604 --> 00:40:31,404
But I need you to submit
your vocabulary words

447
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:32,849
before the next session.

448
00:40:32,941 --> 00:40:34,443
Fair.

449
00:40:34,509 --> 00:40:36,955
And remember what happened
to the Aborigines.

450
00:40:37,178 --> 00:40:40,990
A more advanced race
nearly wiped them out.

451
00:40:48,356 --> 00:40:49,801
It's a good story.

452
00:40:49,891 --> 00:40:51,302
Thanks.

453
00:40:52,293 --> 00:40:53,863
It's not true.

454
00:40:53,962 --> 00:40:56,067
But it proves my point.

455
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:15,183
<i>We think
we were able to reproduce</i>

456
00:41:15,316 --> 00:41:18,024
<i>some prime number sequences
back at them.</i>

457
00:41:18,152 --> 00:41:19,392
<i>So that's something.</i>

458
00:41:19,487 --> 00:41:22,058
Well, congratulations.
You're a parrot.

459
00:41:22,156 --> 00:41:23,801
<i>It's a lot more than that,
you cheeky bastard,</i>

460
00:41:23,825 --> 00:41:24,895
<i>don't you see?</i>

461
00:41:24,993 --> 00:41:26,995
<i>They cam seem to follow our algebra,</i>

462
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:30,941
<i>but complex behaviors, that clicks.</i>

463
00:41:34,202 --> 00:41:37,843
Well that doesn't make
any sense at all, does it?

464
00:41:42,343 --> 00:41:43,921
Problem is,
not everyone shares our policy

465
00:41:43,945 --> 00:41:45,925
of being open with the aliens.

466
00:41:46,014 --> 00:41:48,016
Have you met General Shang?

467
00:41:48,082 --> 00:41:50,255
The call sign for him is Big Domino.

468
00:41:50,351 --> 00:41:51,591
Whatever Shang does,

469
00:41:51,686 --> 00:41:53,427
at least four other nations will follow.

470
00:41:53,521 --> 00:41:55,694
Louise? We have to gain ground today.

471
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,201
<i>Okay.-</i>

472
00:41:57,292 --> 00:42:00,705
- You have a vocabulary list for me?
- I do.

473
00:42:04,866 --> 00:42:08,211
You're gonna teach them
your name and Ian's?

474
00:42:08,269 --> 00:42:09,771
Yes, so that we can learn

475
00:42:09,871 --> 00:42:11,544
their names if they have names,

476
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:13,448
and then introduce pronouns later.

477
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:15,111
These are all grade-school words:

478
00:42:15,209 --> 00:42:17,553
eat, walk.

479
00:42:19,914 --> 00:42:21,587
Help me understand.

480
00:42:22,617 --> 00:42:24,290
Okay. Um...

481
00:42:27,622 --> 00:42:29,465
Oh, no, no, no! Not the top!

482
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:37,105
Okay, this is where
you wanna get to, right?

483
00:42:37,165 --> 00:42:38,667
- That is the question.
- Okay.

484
00:42:38,766 --> 00:42:40,973
So, first, we need to make sure that

485
00:42:41,069 --> 00:42:43,140
they understand what a question is.

486
00:42:43,237 --> 00:42:47,014
Okay, the nature of
a request for information

487
00:42:47,108 --> 00:42:48,678
along with a response.

488
00:42:48,776 --> 00:42:52,986
Then, we need to clarify
the difference between

489
00:42:53,081 --> 00:42:56,187
a specific "you" and a collective "you,"

490
00:42:56,284 --> 00:43:00,460
because we don't wanna know
why Joe Alien is here,

491
00:43:00,521 --> 00:43:03,434
we want to know why they all landed.

492
00:43:03,491 --> 00:43:06,938
And purpose requires
an understanding of intent.

493
00:43:06,995 --> 00:43:08,303
We need to find out:

494
00:43:08,363 --> 00:43:10,309
do they make conscious choices?

495
00:43:10,365 --> 00:43:12,504
Or is their motivation so instinctive

496
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,638
that they don't understand
a "why' question at all?

497
00:43:15,703 --> 00:43:17,205
And... And biggest of all,

498
00:43:17,305 --> 00:43:19,512
we need to have enough
vocabulary with them

499
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,347
that we understand their answer.

500
00:43:23,878 --> 00:43:25,516
I get it.

501
00:43:25,613 --> 00:43:27,957
Stick to your list.

502
00:43:28,016 --> 00:43:29,518
Just

503
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:33,321
don't add anything to it.

504
00:43:46,868 --> 00:43:48,848
Mare at <i>2.97.</i>

505
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:51,007
<i>21.4%. Over.</i>

506
00:43:51,139 --> 00:43:53,676
<i>Condor, Alpha's now in the nave.</i>

507
00:43:53,808 --> 00:43:56,584
<i>Setting up equipment
and telemetry. Over.</i>

508
00:43:56,677 --> 00:43:58,179
Let's get started.

509
00:44:07,889 --> 00:44:12,201
<i>Louise. Louise. I am Louise.</i>

510
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:20,679
<i>What is that?</i>

511
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:24,377
<i>Is that a new symbol? I can'! tell.</i>

512
00:44:24,505 --> 00:44:27,179
<i>I don't know.
I think it's the symbol for human again.</i>

513
00:44:27,241 --> 00:44:29,551
<i>It just has a lime um on the end,</i>

514
00:44:29,677 --> 00:44:31,554
<i>maybe to indicate</i> a <i>question.</i>

515
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:33,352
<i>1 don't know.</i>

516
00:44:33,448 --> 00:44:34,620
<i>I don? know, Louise.</i>

517
00:44:34,715 --> 00:44:37,059
<i>I think they're getting confused.</i>

518
00:44:37,185 --> 00:44:38,596
Dr. Banks,

519
00:44:38,686 --> 00:44:40,893
<i>perhaps we should
move on to the next word.</i>

520
00:44:59,373 --> 00:45:00,716
<i>Dr. Banks!</i>

521
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:03,211
<i>It's</i> okay.

522
00:45:03,377 --> 00:45:04,378
<i>What's going on?</i>

523
00:45:04,479 --> 00:45:05,787
<i>Hey! What are you doing?</i>

524
00:45:05,913 --> 00:45:07,153
Yeah, I'm fine.

525
00:45:07,248 --> 00:45:08,886
<i>Are you insane?</i>

526
00:45:08,983 --> 00:45:10,621
They need to see me.

527
00:45:10,718 --> 00:45:12,561
<i>She's taking off her hazmat suit.</i>

528
00:45:15,289 --> 00:45:16,290
Is it okay?

529
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:17,534
<i>You're risking contamination.</i>

530
00:45:17,558 --> 00:45:19,003
They need to see me.

531
00:45:19,127 --> 00:45:20,572
Dr. Banks...

532
00:45:20,661 --> 00:45:21,799
<i>Dr. Banks.</i>

533
00:45:21,896 --> 00:45:24,172
<i>She's walking
towards the screen.</i>

534
00:45:27,068 --> 00:45:28,638
<i>Should we abort?</i>

535
00:45:28,736 --> 00:45:31,148
<i>Recourse noted.
Stand by for further orders.</i>

536
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:33,845
<i>Go back to your stations.</i>

537
00:46:48,416 --> 00:46:51,863
Now that's a proper introduction. Hey.

538
00:47:03,097 --> 00:47:04,940
Louise.

539
00:47:07,368 --> 00:47:09,075
I am Louise.

540
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:12,413
Ian, do you want to introduce yourself?

541
00:47:15,009 --> 00:47:16,386
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

542
00:47:20,248 --> 00:47:22,353
Louise.

543
00:47:26,087 --> 00:47:27,725
<i>Screw it!</i>

544
00:47:31,525 --> 00:47:33,562
<i>Everybody dies, right?</i>

545
00:47:35,396 --> 00:47:38,775
<i>Sir, Donnelly is
taking off his hazmat suit.</i>

546
00:47:38,866 --> 00:47:41,107
<i>Permission to abort?</i>

547
00:47:41,202 --> 00:47:42,875
<i>Continue the session.</i>

548
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:00,626
Ian.

549
00:48:00,721 --> 00:48:02,257
Louise.

550
00:48:03,591 --> 00:48:05,332
You...

551
00:48:06,727 --> 00:48:08,263
Who are you?

552
00:48:35,523 --> 00:48:37,298
I think those are their names.

553
00:48:40,795 --> 00:48:42,672
They have names.

554
00:48:42,763 --> 00:48:45,107
So, what are we gonna call them?

555
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:46,769
I don't know.

556
00:48:48,102 --> 00:48:50,275
I was thinking Abbott and Costello.

557
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,681
Yeah.

558
00:48:54,775 --> 00:48:56,516
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I like it.

559
00:48:59,046 --> 00:49:00,855
I like it.

560
00:49:00,948 --> 00:49:02,552
Wow!

561
00:49:14,795 --> 00:49:17,207
Team 1, exit your vehicle

562
00:49:17,298 --> 00:49:20,973
<i>and proceed directly ahead
to the decontamination tent.</i>

563
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:30,646
<i>Leave your respirator on until
you reach the equipment</i> room.

564
00:49:58,873 --> 00:50:01,513
I know. Shhh!

565
00:50:07,014 --> 00:50:10,018
<i>Team 2, exit your vehicles</i>

566
00:50:10,084 --> 00:50:13,554
<i>and continue to
the decontamination tent.</i>

567
00:50:13,621 --> 00:50:15,191
<i>Leave your respirators on</i>

568
00:50:15,256 --> 00:50:16,894
<i>and do not hesitate</i>

569
00:50:16,957 --> 00:50:18,800
<i>until you have reached
the equipment room.</i>

570
00:50:21,896 --> 00:50:23,398
How do you feel?

571
00:50:24,432 --> 00:50:26,241
<i>Overworked.</i>

572
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,302
Well, I guess I don't need to tell you

573
00:50:28,402 --> 00:50:29,881
you're putting yourself at risk.

574
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:33,449
There's no signs of
radiation poisoning yet.

575
00:50:33,541 --> 00:50:36,249
We'll see how your blood tests look.

576
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:38,881
For now, I'm gonna
give you another boost.

577
00:50:38,946 --> 00:50:40,391
<i>Okay.-</i>

578
00:50:40,448 --> 00:50:42,257
No radiation.

579
00:50:42,316 --> 00:50:43,989
Nothing else we can detect either,

580
00:50:44,084 --> 00:50:46,462
but I'd give them a strong
cocktail, regardless.

581
00:50:46,554 --> 00:50:49,330
It's the first time
we've made significant progress.

582
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:54,937
All right. We'll take the risk.

583
00:50:54,995 --> 00:50:56,338
Okay, honey...

584
00:50:56,464 --> 00:50:57,808
<i>What is going on there?</i>

585
00:50:57,832 --> 00:50:59,004
Honey...

586
00:50:59,133 --> 00:51:00,271
<i>Just tell me!</i>

587
00:51:00,334 --> 00:51:02,280
You don't need to worry, okay?

588
00:51:02,336 --> 00:51:05,010
<i>- How can I not worry?</i>
- Just <i>calm</i> down.

589
00:51:05,105 --> 00:51:06,641
Just calm down.

590
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:10,517
<i>Becky asked me
if the monsters are going to kill Daddy!</i>

591
00:51:10,611 --> 00:51:13,182
Honey, it's not gonna happen.

592
00:51:15,749 --> 00:51:17,092
<i>Just stay safe.</i>

593
00:51:17,251 --> 00:51:18,594
You don't need to worry.

594
00:51:18,652 --> 00:51:20,654
<i>Please! I'm so scared!</i>

595
00:51:23,691 --> 00:51:25,693
<i>All junior xenolinguistics</i>

596
00:51:25,793 --> 00:51:27,966
<i>and science personnel must observe</i>

597
00:51:28,028 --> 00:51:30,668
<i>general curfew
unless expressly authorized</i>

598
00:51:30,764 --> 00:51:33,370
<i>for extended work hours by unit COs.</i>

599
00:51:33,467 --> 00:51:37,108
<i>Curfew in effect as of 2200 hours.</i>

600
00:51:37,638 --> 00:51:41,780
<i>Notice to all late workers,
fire watchers and night staff</i>

601
00:51:41,842 --> 00:51:46,291
<i>Effective immediately,
midnight rations will be served all night.</i>

602
00:52:34,361 --> 00:52:36,534
<i>Here are some of the many things</i>

603
00:52:36,664 --> 00:52:38,666
<i>we don't know about heptapods.</i>

604
00:52:38,766 --> 00:52:42,043
<i>Greek. Hepta, "Seven." Pod, "Foot."</i>

605
00:52:42,169 --> 00:52:44,706
Seven feet. Heptapod.

606
00:52:46,173 --> 00:52:47,743
<i>Who are they?</i>

607
00:52:47,841 --> 00:52:50,685
<i>Trying to answer this
in any meaningful way</i>

608
00:52:50,778 --> 00:52:52,519
<i>is hampered by the fact that,</i>

609
00:52:52,613 --> 00:52:55,526
<i>outside being able to see them
and hear them,</i>

610
00:52:55,616 --> 00:52:58,688
<i>the heptapods leave
absolutely no footprint.</i>

611
00:53:00,387 --> 00:53:03,960
<i>The chemical composition of
their spaceship is unknown,</i>

612
00:53:04,058 --> 00:53:07,267
<i>The shell emits no waste,
no gas, no radiation.</i>

613
00:53:07,361 --> 00:53:10,604
<i>Assuming that the shells
communicate with each other,</i>

614
00:53:10,698 --> 00:53:13,269
<i>they do so without detection.</i>

615
00:53:13,367 --> 00:53:15,870
<i>The air between the shells is untroubled</i>

616
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:17,916
<i>by sonic emission or light wave.</i>

617
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,952
<i>Are they scientists? Or tourists?</i>

618
00:53:22,042 --> 00:53:23,453
<i>H they're scientists,</i>

619
00:53:23,544 --> 00:53:25,820
<i>they don't seem to ask a lot of questions.</i>

620
00:53:28,882 --> 00:53:31,226
<i>Why did they park where they did?</i>

621
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:34,788
<i>The worlds most decorated
experts can't crack that one.</i>

622
00:53:34,888 --> 00:53:36,458
<i>The most plausible theory is</i>

623
00:53:36,557 --> 00:53:38,059
<i>that they chose places on Earth</i>

624
00:53:38,158 --> 00:53:40,638
<i>with the lowest incidence
of lightning strikes.</i>

625
00:53:40,728 --> 00:53:42,730
<i>But there are exceptions.</i>

626
00:53:42,796 --> 00:53:44,798
<i>The next most plausible theory is that</i>

627
00:53:44,898 --> 00:53:46,468
<i>Sheena Easton had a hit song</i>

628
00:53:46,567 --> 00:53:48,069
<i>at each of these sites in 1980.</i>

629
00:53:48,135 --> 00:53:49,808
<i>So, we just don'! know.</i>

630
00:53:52,473 --> 00:53:54,817
<i>How do they communicate?</i>

631
00:53:54,908 --> 00:53:57,980
<i>Here, Louise is putting us all to shame.</i>

632
00:53:58,078 --> 00:53:59,751
<i>The first breakthrough was</i>

633
00:53:59,813 --> 00:54:02,419
<i>to discover that there's no correlation</i>

634
00:54:02,516 --> 00:54:06,259
<i>between what a heptapod says
and what a heptapod writes.</i>

635
00:54:21,168 --> 00:54:23,512
<i>Unlike all written human languages,</i>

636
00:54:23,604 --> 00:54:26,107
<i>their writing is semasiographic.</i>

637
00:54:26,173 --> 00:54:29,677
<i>It conveys meaning.
It doesn't represent sound.</i>

638
00:54:34,214 --> 00:54:36,319
<i>Perhaps they view our form of writing</i>

639
00:54:36,383 --> 00:54:38,727
<i>as a wasted opportunity,</i>

640
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:41,390
<i>passing up a second
communications channel.</i>

641
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,370
<i>We have our friends in Pakistan to thank</i>

642
00:54:49,463 --> 00:54:52,467
<i>for their study of how heptapods write,</i>

643
00:54:52,533 --> 00:54:56,481
<i>because unlike speech,
a logogram is free of time.</i>

644
00:54:59,373 --> 00:55:01,375
<i>Like their ship or their bodies,</i>

645
00:55:01,475 --> 00:55:03,853
<i>their written language has no forward</i>

646
00:55:03,911 --> 00:55:05,254
<i>or backward direction.</i>

647
00:55:05,345 --> 00:55:09,225
<i>Linguists call this
non-linear orthography,</i>

648
00:55:09,316 --> 00:55:12,729
<i>which raises the question,
"ls this how they think?"</i>

649
00:55:14,421 --> 00:55:17,698
<i>Imagine you wanted to write
a sentence using two hands,</i>

650
00:55:17,758 --> 00:55:19,328
<i>starring from either side.</i>

651
00:55:19,393 --> 00:55:22,567
<i>You would have to know
each word you wanted to use,</i>

652
00:55:22,663 --> 00:55:25,439
<i>as well as how much space
they would occupy.</i>

653
00:55:27,668 --> 00:55:29,705
<i>A heptapod can write
a complex sentence</i>

654
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:31,909
<i>in two seconds, effortlessly.</i>

655
00:55:32,005 --> 00:55:34,884
<i>It's taken us a month
to make the simplest reply.</i>

656
00:55:34,942 --> 00:55:37,946
<i>Next, expanding vocabulary.</i>

657
00:55:38,045 --> 00:55:39,823
<i>Louise thinks it could
easily take another month</i>

658
00:55:39,847 --> 00:55:41,349
<i>to be ready for that.</i>

659
00:55:58,699 --> 00:56:00,372
Hey...

660
00:56:01,368 --> 00:56:03,041
Oh, hey.

661
00:56:03,137 --> 00:56:05,310
Weber's looking for you.

662
00:56:05,405 --> 00:56:08,113
Yeah, well, why do you think
I'm hiding out here?

663
00:56:09,643 --> 00:56:11,213
Come on up!

664
00:56:13,213 --> 00:56:14,715
Thanks.

665
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:19,658
Nice out here, huh?

666
00:56:19,753 --> 00:56:22,131
Yeah, it's a nice view.

667
00:56:22,222 --> 00:56:24,395
Away from the noise.

668
00:56:27,394 --> 00:56:29,670
You know, I was just thinking about you.

669
00:56:32,399 --> 00:56:34,640
You approach language
like a mathematician.

670
00:56:34,735 --> 00:56:37,909
You know that, right?

671
00:56:38,005 --> 00:56:40,246
I will take that as a compliment.

672
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,819
Yeah, well, it is.

673
00:56:44,011 --> 00:56:47,823
As I watch you steer us around
these communication traps

674
00:56:47,915 --> 00:56:49,986
that I didn't even know existed,

675
00:56:50,083 --> 00:56:51,824
it's like, "What?"

676
00:56:54,021 --> 00:56:55,932
I guess that's why I'm single.

677
00:56:56,023 --> 00:56:59,095
Trust me, you can
understand communication

678
00:56:59,193 --> 00:57:00,831
and still end up single.

679
00:57:10,103 --> 00:57:13,346
I feel like everything
that happens in there

680
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,545
comes down to the two of us.

681
00:57:17,611 --> 00:57:19,613
Yeah, that's a good thing though, right?

682
00:57:19,713 --> 00:57:21,158
You and I?

683
00:57:24,618 --> 00:57:27,963
Have you seen the jokers
that we're working with?

684
00:57:28,055 --> 00:57:29,625
Thank God I've got you!

685
00:57:40,868 --> 00:57:42,142
<i>Tonight,</i>

686
00:57:42,236 --> 00:57:45,149
<i>the first photograph
of the aliens goes viral.</i>

687
00:57:45,205 --> 00:57:47,981
<i>Biological contamination
is a major risk factor</i>

688
00:57:48,041 --> 00:57:49,315
<i>at the Montana site.</i>

689
00:57:49,376 --> 00:57:51,481
<i>So say environmental pressure groups.</i>

690
00:57:51,578 --> 00:57:53,387
<i>800, 000 march on Washington</i>

691
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,051
<i>to protest the government's
handling of the crisis.</i>

692
00:57:56,149 --> 00:57:58,993
<i>All this, and more special coverage.</i>

693
00:58:01,088 --> 00:58:02,866
<i>First contact with
whoever it is that is inside that thing,</i>

694
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:04,233
<i>and who's running the show?</i>

695
00:58:04,324 --> 00:58:05,564
<i>The government.</i>

696
00:58:05,659 --> 00:58:07,661
<i>That's right, folks, the same government</i>

697
00:58:07,728 --> 00:58:10,334
<i>who ruined our healthcare
and bankrupted our military.</i>

698
00:58:10,397 --> 00:58:11,501
<i>Look at these people!</i>

699
00:58:11,565 --> 00:58:13,340
<i>Most of them don't even have guns!</i>

700
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,402
<i>We could be facing a full-scale invasion.</i>

701
00:58:15,502 --> 00:58:17,243
<i>Our president's willing to sit back</i>

702
00:58:17,337 --> 00:58:19,510
<i>and let them waltz in
and take our country.</i>

703
00:58:19,573 --> 00:58:21,849
<i>We are failing asleep
at the wheel, people!</i>

704
00:58:21,942 --> 00:58:24,183
<i>You know what I'm talking
about. I know you do.</i>

705
00:58:24,244 --> 00:58:26,588
<i>What if the smartest thing
we could do right now</i>

706
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,523
<i>would be to give them</i> a <i>show of force?</i>

707
00:58:28,582 --> 00:58:30,584
<i>I'm talking about</i> a <i>shot across the bow.</i>

708
00:58:30,684 --> 00:58:31,685
<i>What do you think?</i>

709
00:58:31,752 --> 00:58:33,231
<i>Caller No. 1, you're on the air.</i>

710
00:58:33,287 --> 00:58:34,561
<i>What do you think?</i>

711
00:59:00,781 --> 00:59:02,556
<i>What's this word?</i>

712
00:59:18,565 --> 00:59:20,067
Planet.

713
00:59:25,505 --> 00:59:28,645
That's, like, um...
The Earth is a planet.

714
00:59:28,742 --> 00:59:32,747
<i>Want to see my project
for Miss Garriott's class?</i>

715
00:59:32,813 --> 00:59:34,520
Yeah, little nose.

716
00:59:37,484 --> 00:59:40,260
We had to make up our own TV show.

717
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,322
If we had one.

718
00:59:42,422 --> 00:59:43,902
And who are those two people?

719
00:59:43,991 --> 00:59:45,334
That's you and Dad.

720
00:59:45,425 --> 00:59:46,836
The show is called

721
00:59:46,927 --> 00:59:49,100
"Mommy and Daddy talk to Animals."

722
00:59:49,196 --> 00:59:51,005
Oh!

723
00:59:51,098 --> 00:59:53,100
Well, it's lovely.

724
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:58,547
Okay...

725
00:59:59,539 --> 01:00:01,109
Um...

726
01:00:02,509 --> 01:00:04,853
You know it's okay to be sad
that your dad and I...

727
01:00:04,945 --> 01:00:06,447
I know. I'm not.

728
01:00:08,448 --> 01:00:10,689
'Cause we both love you very much.

729
01:00:10,784 --> 01:00:13,355
I know. It's just a cartoon. It's not real.

730
01:00:13,453 --> 01:00:15,023
Louise?

731
01:00:19,126 --> 01:00:20,571
You all right?

732
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:24,735
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

733
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:30,978
I'm not sure it's something
I can... I can explain.

734
01:00:31,038 --> 01:00:33,814
When was
your last checkup with Dr. Kettler?

735
01:00:33,907 --> 01:00:35,648
I'm okay.

736
01:00:35,742 --> 01:00:38,052
I'm gonna get some air.

737
01:00:38,145 --> 01:00:40,147
- I'm okay.
- All right.

738
01:00:40,247 --> 01:00:41,920
I'm fine. Yep.

739
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:43,385
<i>How you feeling?</i>

740
01:01:43,443 --> 01:01:45,116
Um...

741
01:01:46,413 --> 01:01:50,828
I need some sleep, but I'm fine.

742
01:01:50,917 --> 01:01:52,294
Yeah.

743
01:01:53,653 --> 01:01:55,826
You know, I was doing
some reading, um,

744
01:01:55,922 --> 01:01:57,333
about this idea

745
01:01:57,424 --> 01:02:00,803
that if you immerse yourself
into a foreign language,

746
01:02:00,894 --> 01:02:03,465
then you can actually rewire your brain.

747
01:02:03,563 --> 01:02:05,474
The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.

748
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,510
Mm-hmm.

749
01:02:07,601 --> 01:02:09,239
The theory that, uh...

750
01:02:09,302 --> 01:02:11,304
It... It's the theory that, uh,

751
01:02:11,404 --> 01:02:13,111
the language you speak determines

752
01:02:13,173 --> 01:02:14,618
how you think and...

753
01:02:14,674 --> 01:02:17,154
Yeah. It affects
how you see everything.

754
01:02:17,244 --> 01:02:18,518
It was, uh...

755
01:02:18,612 --> 01:02:20,649
I'm curious...

756
01:02:20,747 --> 01:02:23,250
Are you dreaming in their language?

757
01:02:33,026 --> 01:02:36,098
I may have had a few dreams,
but I don't...

758
01:02:37,631 --> 01:02:41,272
I don't think that that
makes me unfit to do this job.

759
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:01,724
Did you sleep?

760
01:03:01,855 --> 01:03:03,027
A little.

761
01:03:04,024 --> 01:03:05,401
Do you know Mandarin?

762
01:03:09,663 --> 01:03:11,142
It is shifting.

763
01:03:18,071 --> 01:03:20,312
The voice you're about to hear

764
01:03:20,373 --> 01:03:22,717
belongs to a Chinese military chief...

765
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:26,149
General Shang.

766
01:03:26,213 --> 01:03:27,715
Pull <i>n</i> up!

767
01:03:30,684 --> 01:03:33,324
We got a satellite feed here
of who he's talking to,

768
01:03:33,386 --> 01:03:35,332
if you want to look.

769
01:03:35,388 --> 01:03:36,890
Wait, go back.

770
01:03:38,358 --> 01:03:39,894
<i>Stop-</i>

771
01:03:41,761 --> 01:03:43,832
He's saying that each of the 12

772
01:03:43,897 --> 01:03:45,877
is offering advanced technology.

773
01:03:48,068 --> 01:03:50,378
Go back again. And play.

774
01:03:52,572 --> 01:03:53,573
Um...

775
01:03:54,107 --> 01:03:58,078
"Our science team
is attempting to decode the sets."

776
01:03:58,511 --> 01:04:01,082
"Sets." I don't know what that means.

777
01:04:01,181 --> 01:04:02,751
Something about advantage,

778
01:04:02,849 --> 01:04:05,693
suits, honor and, uh, flowers.

779
01:04:05,752 --> 01:04:07,288
I don't...

780
01:04:08,288 --> 01:04:10,268
I don't know. That's all.

781
01:04:10,357 --> 01:04:12,769
I don't know what it means either.

782
01:04:12,859 --> 01:04:15,237
An hour ago, China mobilized forces.

783
01:04:15,295 --> 01:04:17,775
And now, Russia's following suit.

784
01:04:17,864 --> 01:04:20,208
Shang's about to start something.

785
01:04:20,267 --> 01:04:22,269
Following suit. Suits.

786
01:04:24,271 --> 01:04:26,945
Suits, honor, flowers...

787
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,782
Colonel, those are
all tile sets in mah-jongg.

788
01:04:31,544 --> 01:04:33,421
God, are they...

789
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,654
Are they using a game
to converse with their heptapods?

790
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:40,322
Maybe. Why?

791
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:43,833
Well, let's say that
I taught them chess instead of English.

792
01:04:43,923 --> 01:04:45,960
Every conversation would be a game.

793
01:04:46,059 --> 01:04:49,131
Every idea expressed through
opposition, victory, defeat.

794
01:04:49,229 --> 01:04:50,503
You see the problem?

795
01:04:50,597 --> 01:04:52,304
Hmm...

796
01:04:52,399 --> 01:04:54,640
If all I ever gave you was a hammer...

797
01:04:54,734 --> 01:04:56,611
Everything's a nail.

798
01:04:58,171 --> 01:05:00,412
We need to ask the big question.

799
01:05:01,508 --> 01:05:03,249
Ready or not.

800
01:05:16,256 --> 01:05:18,327
Yeah, I know,
but between there and there.

801
01:05:20,093 --> 01:05:22,266
Well, it's time to go.

802
01:05:43,817 --> 01:05:45,626
Okay...

803
01:05:49,789 --> 01:05:52,065
Heptapods' purpose.

804
01:06:01,634 --> 01:06:05,241
Heptapod purpose Earth.
What is your purpose?

805
01:06:12,245 --> 01:06:14,350
Do we only have Costello?

806
01:06:19,352 --> 01:06:21,764
Okay. There you are.

807
01:06:43,209 --> 01:06:44,711
What does it say?

808
01:06:53,286 --> 01:06:55,027
Offer weapon.

809
01:06:59,959 --> 01:07:01,063
You saw what they wrote!

810
01:07:01,194 --> 01:07:02,505
Using a word they don't fully understand.

811
01:07:02,529 --> 01:07:04,099
- Could be a request.
- A warning.

812
01:07:04,197 --> 01:07:07,110
Enough! Louise?

813
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,237
We don't know if they understand

814
01:07:09,369 --> 01:07:11,940
the difference between
a weapon and a tool.

815
01:07:12,038 --> 01:07:13,915
Our language, like our culture, is messy,

816
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,781
and sometimes, one can be both.

817
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:17,252
And it's quite possible

818
01:07:17,377 --> 01:07:19,584
that they're asking us
to offer them something,

819
01:07:19,712 --> 01:07:21,089
not the other way around.

820
01:07:21,214 --> 01:07:23,285
It's like the first part of a trade.

821
01:07:23,383 --> 01:07:25,260
So, how do we clarify their intentions

822
01:07:25,385 --> 01:07:26,659
beyond those two words?

823
01:07:26,753 --> 01:07:27,754
Well, I go back in.

824
01:07:27,887 --> 01:07:29,764
Right away, we go back in
and we clear this up.

825
01:07:29,823 --> 01:07:31,461
It's more complicated than that.

826
01:07:31,558 --> 01:07:33,970
How is it more complicated than that?

827
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:36,438
Colonel, the Secretary of Defense

828
01:07:36,563 --> 01:07:38,099
is on the line for you.

829
01:07:44,904 --> 01:07:46,747
We need to sit on this information

830
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,251
till we know what it means,

831
01:07:48,341 --> 01:07:50,184
so we aren't sharing it with our enemies.

832
01:07:50,276 --> 01:07:51,687
We must consider the idea

833
01:07:51,778 --> 01:07:53,823
that our visitors are prodding us
to fight among ourselves

834
01:07:53,847 --> 01:07:56,327
until only one faction prevails.

835
01:07:56,416 --> 01:07:58,327
- There's no evidence of that.
- Sure there is.

836
01:07:58,418 --> 01:08:00,796
Just grab a history book.

837
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:04,493
The British with India,
the Germans with Rwanda.

838
01:08:04,591 --> 01:08:07,037
They even got a name for it in Hungary.

839
01:08:11,764 --> 01:08:16,509
Yeah. We're a world
with no single leader.

840
01:08:16,603 --> 01:08:18,280
It's impossible to
deal with just one of us.

841
01:08:18,304 --> 01:08:20,682
And with the word "weapon" now...

842
01:08:20,773 --> 01:08:24,448
Halpern. Yes, sir!

843
01:08:42,228 --> 01:08:45,698
No confirmation yet. Standing by.

844
01:08:45,798 --> 01:08:49,746
Anything? What did they say?

845
01:08:51,070 --> 01:08:52,381
China and Russia are off the grid.

846
01:08:52,405 --> 01:08:53,713
They aren't speaking to anyone.

847
01:08:53,806 --> 01:08:57,413
Whatever they learned
in their last session has them spooked.

848
01:08:59,145 --> 01:09:00,522
YES, sir!

849
01:09:00,647 --> 01:09:02,388
We have orders to do the same.

850
01:09:02,482 --> 01:09:03,654
These are our allies!

851
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:04,888
You can't shut us down!

852
01:09:04,984 --> 01:09:06,657
- Put us on radio silence.
- Do it.

853
01:09:06,753 --> 01:09:10,326
We received a message
from the hept... Damn it!

854
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:12,865
We need to be talking to each other!

855
01:09:12,992 --> 01:09:15,700
You want to talk to them?
Find out what this means.

856
01:09:20,833 --> 01:09:22,870
<i>Base-camp talk is now offline.</i>

857
01:09:23,002 --> 01:09:25,278
<i>All interpreters and
international liaisons,</i>

858
01:09:25,371 --> 01:09:28,944
<i>stand down and
report to unit coordinators.</i>

859
01:09:30,843 --> 01:09:33,449
We've never
re-entered a session before.

860
01:09:33,546 --> 01:09:36,186
Louise, trust me, okay?
We've got time.

861
01:09:36,282 --> 01:09:38,421
We've just gotta step on it' all right?

862
01:09:38,518 --> 01:09:40,464
"Use weapon."

863
01:09:40,553 --> 01:09:41,896
<i>This is the alien message</i>

864
01:09:42,021 --> 01:09:44,228
<i>said to have provoked
the Chinese government</i>

865
01:09:44,357 --> 01:09:46,030
<i>to withdraw their scientists from</i>

866
01:09:46,125 --> 01:09:47,695
<i>the international mission today.</i>

867
01:09:47,794 --> 01:09:49,967
<i>In a statement, General Shang said,</i>

868
01:09:50,063 --> 01:09:52,202
<i>"China no longer trusts the aliens</i>

869
01:09:52,298 --> 01:09:53,641
<i>"who want to divide us.</i>

870
01:09:53,733 --> 01:09:56,407
<i>"Humanity must be protected."</i>

871
01:09:56,536 --> 01:09:59,210
<i>China has asked for immediate
talks at the UN.</i>

872
01:10:02,075 --> 01:10:03,986
<i>Alpha one niner,</i>

873
01:10:04,077 --> 01:10:05,579
<i>this is Condor, over.</i>

874
01:10:09,215 --> 01:10:13,721
<i>Alpha-one-niner,
this is Condor, come in. Over.</i>

875
01:10:18,257 --> 01:10:21,238
<i>Captain Marks, Condor
not receiving transmission.</i>

876
01:10:21,561 --> 01:10:23,507
<i>Squelch Mice if you hear line.</i>

877
01:10:24,497 --> 01:10:26,272
<i>Captain Marks, all escort units</i>

878
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:28,174
<i>are ordered to cease all activity.</i>

879
01:10:58,765 --> 01:11:01,109
No, no, no.
Dr. Banks, you can't go in there.

880
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,111
I just need to ask one question.

881
01:11:03,169 --> 01:11:05,171
Dr. Banks!
The session is finished.

882
01:11:05,271 --> 01:11:07,512
You can't... You can't go
back in. It's dangerous.

883
01:11:07,607 --> 01:11:09,485
Look, we just need
five minutes. Don't sweat it.

884
01:11:09,509 --> 01:11:11,284
Marks, let them go.

885
01:11:14,047 --> 01:11:15,958
Hey, Abbott!

886
01:11:20,953 --> 01:11:24,025
So, what are we calling this'?
Session 37?

887
01:11:24,123 --> 01:11:26,626
Uh, no, 36, part 2.

888
01:11:33,966 --> 01:11:35,536
Why are they on their own?

889
01:11:35,635 --> 01:11:37,979
We've been attempting
to hail Captain Marks.

890
01:11:38,037 --> 01:11:39,812
The escort units are not responding, sir.

891
01:11:39,872 --> 01:11:42,978
Why not? Send security.

892
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:50,052
"Offer weapon, question mark."

893
01:11:55,154 --> 01:11:57,566
Are you offering us something?

894
01:12:06,165 --> 01:12:09,169
Technology, apparatus, method?

895
01:12:09,235 --> 01:12:11,408
Yeah, see, this is a different word.

896
01:12:11,504 --> 01:12:14,246
This... This segment, it's a lot busier.

897
01:12:19,512 --> 01:12:23,119
Give technology

898
01:12:24,417 --> 01:12:26,124
How.

899
01:12:34,627 --> 01:12:36,607
What's he doing?

900
01:12:41,634 --> 01:12:43,545
<i>Captain, on your ten.</i>

901
01:12:52,545 --> 01:12:54,616
<i>Security detail inbound, sir.</i>

902
01:12:54,714 --> 01:12:57,388
<i>T-minus 4 minutes remaining.
We need to see this through.</i>

903
01:12:57,450 --> 01:12:59,452
<i>Okay, this is it.
Lock and load.</i>

904
01:12:59,552 --> 01:13:01,793
<i>We just need to
hold them off until it's done.</i>

905
01:13:01,888 --> 01:13:04,391
<i>Copy that.
Warning shots and suppressive fire only.</i>

906
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:05,770
<i>Load up and get to coven.</i>

907
01:13:05,825 --> 01:13:07,998
<i>Stay frosty and we can avoid casualties.</i>

908
01:13:34,587 --> 01:13:37,090
Abbott wants me to write on the barrier.

909
01:13:42,028 --> 01:13:43,871
Can you even do that?

910
01:13:45,097 --> 01:13:46,872
I don't know.

911
01:14:02,782 --> 01:14:04,625
I can't do it with both hands.

912
01:15:16,022 --> 01:15:17,763
Louise...

913
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:34,279
What is that?

914
01:16:19,752 --> 01:16:22,426
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

915
01:16:22,488 --> 01:16:25,264
You suffered a concussion.
Just lay back.

916
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:30,331
How do you feel?

917
01:16:38,437 --> 01:16:39,939
How is Ian?

918
01:16:40,006 --> 01:16:42,179
Same as you. He's okay.

919
01:16:43,542 --> 01:16:46,284
Who, um... Who did this?

920
01:16:46,345 --> 01:16:48,120
Ah, some soldiers.

921
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:50,456
They've been watching too much TV.

922
01:16:53,452 --> 01:16:55,022
What is that?

923
01:16:55,121 --> 01:16:56,532
Take it easy. Take it easy.

924
01:16:58,124 --> 01:17:01,196
The sites no longer secure.
We're standing by to evacuate.

925
01:17:01,293 --> 01:17:03,204
Where's Ian?

926
01:17:03,295 --> 01:17:06,208
Weber came and got him
maybe 10 minutes ago.

927
01:17:06,298 --> 01:17:09,040
He wouldn't leave until
he knew you were okay.

928
01:17:12,304 --> 01:17:13,806
Your whole tent is on the clock

929
01:17:13,873 --> 01:17:16,649
to figure out whatever it is
you were given up there.

930
01:17:22,481 --> 01:17:23,892
This is all of it?

931
01:17:23,983 --> 01:17:26,486
The feed wasn't interrupted
by the explosion?

932
01:17:27,987 --> 01:17:29,933
Not as far as I can see.

933
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:32,835
You see something?

934
01:17:32,925 --> 01:17:34,404
Oh, I don't know yet.

935
01:17:34,493 --> 01:17:37,337
I'm gonna need my team to get
together with Louise's team.

936
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:39,000
I need everybody working on this.

937
01:17:39,065 --> 01:17:40,510
We cannot leave.

938
01:17:40,599 --> 01:17:42,010
Glad to see you're awake.

939
01:17:42,068 --> 01:17:44,844
We need to go back in
and explain this wasn't our fault.

940
01:17:44,937 --> 01:17:46,917
- We can't go back inside.
- We have to.

941
01:17:47,006 --> 01:17:49,350
What happened in there was an attack.

942
01:17:49,408 --> 01:17:50,409
We can hope for the best,

943
01:17:50,509 --> 01:17:51,987
but I have orders to
prepare for retaliation.

944
01:17:52,011 --> 01:17:53,422
We may have to evacuate.

945
01:17:53,512 --> 01:17:54,552
No, that's the wrong move.

946
01:17:54,613 --> 01:17:56,854
As long as they stay' we have to stay.

947
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:33,052
Well, they're not leaving.

948
01:18:35,121 --> 01:18:36,896
Why does this feel worse?

949
01:18:41,494 --> 01:18:43,565
<i>China is on the offensive.</i>

950
01:18:43,629 --> 01:18:45,302
<i>They're positioning the military</i>

951
01:18:45,397 --> 01:18:47,109
<i>to blow the alien vessel
right out of the sky.</i>

952
01:18:47,133 --> 01:18:48,635
<i>And if this happens,</i>

953
01:18:48,734 --> 01:18:50,378
<i>we can't sit around
waiting for retaliation.</i>

954
01:18:50,402 --> 01:18:51,972
<i>So, get prepared.</i>

955
01:18:52,738 --> 01:18:55,241
<i>The Air Force and infantry
are standing by.</i>

956
01:18:55,341 --> 01:18:56,342
YES, sir.

957
01:18:57,910 --> 01:19:01,585
<i>Tonight, China becomes
the first world power</i>

958
01:19:01,647 --> 01:19:04,321
<i>to declare war against the aliens.</i>

959
01:19:04,416 --> 01:19:06,987
<i>Following the failure of diplomatic efforts</i>

960
01:19:07,086 --> 01:19:08,588
<i>at the United Nations,</i>

961
01:19:08,654 --> 01:19:11,658
<i>China has confirmed that its
language experts have tonight</i>

962
01:19:11,757 --> 01:19:14,431
<i>delivered an ultimatum
at the Shanghai site.</i>

963
01:19:14,493 --> 01:19:15,938
<i>In a televised statement,</i>

964
01:19:16,028 --> 01:19:19,009
<i>General Shang, chairman of
the People's Liberation Army,</i>

965
01:19:19,098 --> 01:19:22,773
<i>said the aliens have 24 hours
to leave Chinese territory</i>

966
01:19:22,868 --> 01:19:24,176
<i>or face destruction.</i>

967
01:19:24,270 --> 01:19:26,443
<i>And he urged ail other world leaders</i>

968
01:19:26,539 --> 01:19:29,611
<i>to unite with China
and take a similar stance.</i>

969
01:19:30,442 --> 01:19:34,117
<i>With a huge buildup oi forces
at their landing sites,</i>

970
01:19:34,213 --> 01:19:36,955
<i>Pakistan, Russia and Sudan
are thought to be</i>

971
01:19:37,016 --> 01:19:38,620
<i>following China 's lead.</i>

972
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:56,302
It can't be random.

973
01:20:11,317 --> 01:20:13,923
It's going to take us years.

974
01:20:18,924 --> 01:20:20,904
What's this term here?

975
01:20:24,063 --> 01:20:25,906
Mom...

976
01:20:28,567 --> 01:20:30,046
Mom...

977
01:20:30,169 --> 01:20:31,671
Hmm? Sweetie...

978
01:20:31,737 --> 01:20:33,910
Uh, what's this term for that thing,

979
01:20:34,006 --> 01:20:35,917
like a... Like a technical term,

980
01:20:36,008 --> 01:20:37,510
where we make a deal,

981
01:20:37,576 --> 01:20:39,578
and we both get something out of it.

982
01:20:39,678 --> 01:20:41,419
A compromise.

983
01:20:41,513 --> 01:20:42,856
No...

984
01:20:42,915 --> 01:20:45,122
Like, it's a competition.

985
01:20:45,217 --> 01:20:46,787
Mm-hmm...

986
01:20:46,919 --> 01:20:48,455
But both sides end up happy.

987
01:20:49,788 --> 01:20:51,131
Like a win-win.

988
01:20:51,223 --> 01:20:53,396
More science-y than that.

989
01:20:53,459 --> 01:20:56,531
If you want science, call your father.

990
01:21:10,876 --> 01:21:12,219
Thank you.

991
01:21:22,921 --> 01:21:24,662
Sorry.

992
01:21:24,757 --> 01:21:26,065
It's okay.

993
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:28,002
I'm up.

994
01:21:31,964 --> 01:21:33,466
What time is it?

995
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,810
It's time you opened that
bottle you've been hiding.

996
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,143
You cracked something, didn't you?

997
01:21:44,243 --> 01:21:45,483
Yeah. Come here.

998
01:21:47,413 --> 01:21:48,949
Take a look at this section.

999
01:21:49,014 --> 01:21:51,756
It seems to be talking about time.

1000
01:21:51,817 --> 01:21:54,423
Their symbol for time is everywhere.

1001
01:21:54,486 --> 01:21:55,988
So what is this?

1002
01:21:57,423 --> 01:22:00,597
A formula for faster-than-light travel?

1003
01:22:00,659 --> 01:22:02,764
Who can tell?

1004
01:22:02,828 --> 01:22:04,364
There are too many gaps.

1005
01:22:04,463 --> 01:22:05,999
Nothing's complete.

1006
01:22:06,098 --> 01:22:07,600
Then it dawned on me.

1007
01:22:07,666 --> 01:22:09,168
Come here.

1008
01:22:10,202 --> 01:22:11,977
Right here.

1009
01:22:12,037 --> 01:22:15,883
Stop focusing on the ones.
Look at the zeroes.

1010
01:22:15,974 --> 01:22:17,885
How much of this is data?

1011
01:22:17,976 --> 01:22:20,616
How much of it is negative space?

1012
01:22:20,679 --> 01:22:22,556
So, I measured it.

1013
01:22:24,183 --> 01:22:26,663
0.0833 recurring.

1014
01:22:32,458 --> 01:22:35,029
Perhaps you'd like that as a fraction.

1015
01:22:37,996 --> 01:22:39,907
One of twelve.

1016
01:22:42,668 --> 01:22:46,172
What they're saying right here
is that this is one of 12.

1017
01:22:46,238 --> 01:22:48,081
"We are part of a larger whole."

1018
01:22:48,173 --> 01:22:50,346
Or we're one of 12 contestants
for the prize.

1019
01:22:50,409 --> 01:22:51,820
Why do I have to talk to him?

1020
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:53,321
We're all working together.

1021
01:22:53,379 --> 01:22:55,689
We need to talk to the other sites,

1022
01:22:55,748 --> 01:22:58,251
help them with what they've
gotten from the heptapods.

1023
01:22:58,350 --> 01:22:59,556
We're blacked out.

1024
01:22:59,651 --> 01:23:01,858
China just threatened
to destroy their shell.

1025
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:02,990
We're on our own.

1026
01:23:03,055 --> 01:23:04,866
But this says that all of
the pieces fit together.

1027
01:23:04,890 --> 01:23:06,767
And I'm telling you
that no one else cares.

1028
01:23:07,259 --> 01:23:08,397
Two hours ago,

1029
01:23:08,494 --> 01:23:10,565
we pulled this audio off
a secure channel in Russia.

1030
01:23:10,662 --> 01:23:13,336
Someone on the science team
there was broadcasting wide.

1031
01:23:15,934 --> 01:23:18,437
<i>In their final session, the aliens said,</i>

1032
01:23:18,537 --> 01:23:21,575
<i>"There is no time. Many become one."</i>

1033
01:23:21,673 --> 01:23:24,210
<i>I fear we have all been given weapons.</i>

1034
01:23:24,276 --> 01:23:27,951
<i>If anyone is receiving this, please...</i>

1035
01:23:34,119 --> 01:23:35,530
Well, I mean,

1036
01:23:36,722 --> 01:23:38,065
there are a lot of ways

1037
01:23:38,123 --> 01:23:39,534
you can interpret what he said.

1038
01:23:39,591 --> 01:23:41,631
I don't need an interpreter
to know what this means.

1039
01:23:41,727 --> 01:23:43,798
Russia just executed
one of their own experts

1040
01:23:43,896 --> 01:23:45,068
to keep their secret.

1041
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:47,701
"Many become one"
could just be their way of saying

1042
01:23:47,766 --> 01:23:49,473
"some assembly required."

1043
01:23:49,568 --> 01:23:51,309
Why hand it out to us in pieces?

1044
01:23:51,403 --> 01:23:53,110
Why not just give it all over?

1045
01:23:53,205 --> 01:23:55,446
What better way to force us
to work together for once?

1046
01:23:56,608 --> 01:23:57,814
Even if I did believe you,

1047
01:23:57,910 --> 01:24:00,618
how in the world are you gonna
get anybody else to play along

1048
01:24:00,712 --> 01:24:02,623
and give up their <i>data?</i>

1049
01:24:02,714 --> 01:24:04,990
We offer ours in return.

1050
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:06,562
Yeah?

1051
01:24:06,618 --> 01:24:08,063
A trade?

1052
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:09,631
It's a non-zero-sum game.

1053
01:24:12,324 --> 01:24:14,964
Non-zero-sum game.

1054
01:24:15,661 --> 01:24:17,937
That's it. Yeah.

1055
01:24:17,996 --> 01:24:19,839
Thanks.

1056
01:24:25,304 --> 01:24:28,012
Nine of the landing sites
have gone

1057
01:24:28,106 --> 01:24:29,346
total comms blackout.

1058
01:24:29,441 --> 01:24:31,443
Only way to reach them
is lo physically drive there

1059
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:33,922
and yell at the border guards,
which we're doing,

1060
01:24:33,979 --> 01:24:35,287
but it won't be fast enough.

1061
01:24:35,347 --> 01:24:37,759
There must be a way
to get the message to them.

1062
01:24:37,816 --> 01:24:40,763
To our allies, maybe,
but it's too little too late.

1063
01:24:40,819 --> 01:24:43,356
<i>What we need is to get
all the other nations online</i>

1064
01:24:43,455 --> 01:24:45,366
<i>before one starts global wan.</i>

1065
01:24:45,457 --> 01:24:47,437
<i>And there's no way for us to reach them.</i>

1066
01:24:47,493 --> 01:24:50,497
Okay, hold on a second. There is!

1067
01:24:50,596 --> 01:24:52,098
It's right above us.

1068
01:24:53,866 --> 01:24:55,546
That's problematic
for us right now.

1069
01:24:55,601 --> 01:24:58,673
The Pentagon's convinced
our shell will retaliate.

1070
01:24:58,770 --> 01:25:01,876
My guess is they'll order us
to evacuate within the hour.

1071
01:25:01,974 --> 01:25:03,715
Look, they're not our enemy.

1072
01:25:03,809 --> 01:25:05,948
They've made no act of
aggression towards us.

1073
01:25:06,011 --> 01:25:08,091
Maybe this is
their way of being aggressive.

1074
01:25:08,146 --> 01:25:09,648
That's not the question.

1075
01:25:09,715 --> 01:25:11,319
What is the question?

1076
01:25:11,383 --> 01:25:13,659
How do we get you
back in that room

1077
01:25:13,719 --> 01:25:15,357
when it's half a mile straight up?

1078
01:25:15,454 --> 01:25:17,195
I think our work here is done.

1079
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:21,200
It's in the hands of our superiors now.

1080
01:25:40,746 --> 01:25:42,919
What the hell is she doing?

1081
01:26:35,801 --> 01:26:38,714
Oh, my God! Oh, God, no!

1082
01:28:59,511 --> 01:29:01,218
Costello...

1083
01:29:03,749 --> 01:29:05,626
Where's Abbott?

1084
01:29:35,113 --> 01:29:36,786
I'm sorry.

1085
01:29:38,950 --> 01:29:40,987
We're sorry.

1086
01:29:44,623 --> 01:29:46,967
I need you to...

1087
01:29:47,058 --> 01:29:51,336
I need you to send a message
to the other sites.

1088
01:30:10,415 --> 01:30:11,917
I don't...

1089
01:30:11,983 --> 01:30:13,985
I don't understand.

1090
01:30:14,085 --> 01:30:18,124
What is your purpose here?

1091
01:30:44,516 --> 01:30:47,053
How can you know the future?

1092
01:31:02,834 --> 01:31:05,144
I don't...

1093
01:31:06,571 --> 01:31:10,678
I don't understand' Who is this child?

1094
01:31:15,814 --> 01:31:17,521
The show <i>is</i> called

1095
01:31:17,649 --> 01:31:20,095
<i>"Mommy and Daddy talk to Animals."</i>

1096
01:31:53,551 --> 01:31:56,964
Wait! No! Wait!

1097
01:32:46,004 --> 01:32:47,642
- Dr. Banks!
- Louise!

1098
01:32:47,739 --> 01:32:49,412
Are you all right?

1099
01:32:52,410 --> 01:32:54,356
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

1100
01:32:54,446 --> 01:32:55,857
What happened?

1101
01:32:55,947 --> 01:32:58,291
I'm trying to figure it out.
This is too big.

1102
01:32:58,350 --> 01:33:00,830
Doesn't matter now.
We have orders to evacuate.

1103
01:33:00,919 --> 01:33:02,125
Why?

1104
01:33:02,187 --> 01:33:04,258
Russia and Sudan are following China.

1105
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:08,297
I don't understand.

1106
01:33:08,426 --> 01:33:09,598
<i>Help me, Mama.</i>

1107
01:33:10,628 --> 01:33:13,131
Louise? Whoa!

1108
01:33:13,331 --> 01:33:14,366
Mom!

1109
01:33:17,202 --> 01:33:18,704
Mama!

1110
01:33:21,106 --> 01:33:23,108
Sorry, honey.

1111
01:33:26,044 --> 01:33:28,285
What day is it? Do you know, baby?

1112
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:30,121
Sunday.

1113
01:33:35,453 --> 01:33:38,627
Are you gonna leave me like Daddy did?

1114
01:33:38,723 --> 01:33:42,296
Oh, Hannah, honey,
your daddy didn't leave you.

1115
01:33:42,394 --> 01:33:44,465
You're gonna see him this weekend.

1116
01:33:45,797 --> 01:33:48,641
He doesn't look at me
the same way anymore.

1117
01:33:56,875 --> 01:33:58,821
It's my fault.

1118
01:34:00,812 --> 01:34:03,986
I told him something that
he wasn't ready to hear.

1119
01:34:05,817 --> 01:34:07,490
What?

1120
01:34:09,421 --> 01:34:11,230
Well...

1121
01:34:11,322 --> 01:34:13,666
Believe it or not,

1122
01:34:13,725 --> 01:34:16,399
I know something that's going to happen.

1123
01:34:18,496 --> 01:34:21,170
I can't explain how I know. I just do.

1124
01:34:22,767 --> 01:34:26,010
And when I told your daddy,
he got really mad.

1125
01:34:27,739 --> 01:34:30,345
And he said I made the wrong choice.

1126
01:34:32,844 --> 01:34:35,950
What? What's going to happen?

1127
01:34:38,583 --> 01:34:42,793
It has to do with a really rare disease.

1128
01:34:45,623 --> 01:34:47,933
And it's unstoppable.

1129
01:34:49,461 --> 01:34:52,032
Kind of like you are,

1130
01:34:52,130 --> 01:34:55,737
with your swimming and your poetry

1131
01:34:55,867 --> 01:34:57,437
and all the other amazing things

1132
01:34:57,535 --> 01:34:59,276
that you share with the world.

1133
01:34:59,370 --> 01:35:00,906
I'm unstoppable?

1134
01:35:01,906 --> 01:35:03,647
Yeah.

1135
01:35:19,724 --> 01:35:21,567
I got you.

1136
01:35:23,328 --> 01:35:26,400
Louise? Louise?

1137
01:35:28,333 --> 01:35:30,973
I just realized why my husband left me.

1138
01:35:31,069 --> 01:35:32,571
My husband left me.

1139
01:35:32,737 --> 01:35:34,182
You were married?

1140
01:35:34,272 --> 01:35:36,809
Come on! Let's get out of here.

1141
01:36:11,209 --> 01:36:12,620
Mama?

1142
01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:14,121
Yeah?

1143
01:36:14,212 --> 01:36:16,715
Why's my name Hannah?

1144
01:36:18,716 --> 01:36:21,560
Get those people back, please.

1145
01:36:21,653 --> 01:36:24,395
Well, your name is very special,

1146
01:36:24,489 --> 01:36:26,662
because it is a palindrome.

1147
01:36:26,791 --> 01:36:30,466
It reads the same forward and backward.

1148
01:36:30,662 --> 01:36:33,074
All right, guys,
give me a hand here.

1149
01:36:33,164 --> 01:36:35,144
- Yes, sir.
- That goes in the bag.

1150
01:36:39,537 --> 01:36:41,141
Ready to go!

1151
01:37:00,692 --> 01:37:03,696
<i>Evacuation underway.</i>

1152
01:37:06,831 --> 01:37:08,105
Hey...

1153
01:37:08,199 --> 01:37:12,238
We're done here!
We're taking this with us.

1154
01:37:37,028 --> 01:37:38,871
I can read it.

1155
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:44,577
- I know what it is.
- What?

1156
01:37:44,702 --> 01:37:47,205
It's not a weapon. It's a gift.

1157
01:37:47,272 --> 01:37:49,218
The weapon is their language.

1158
01:37:49,274 --> 01:37:51,550
They gave it to us.
Do you know what that means?

1159
01:37:51,609 --> 01:37:54,647
So we can learn Heptapod. If we survive.

1160
01:37:54,746 --> 01:37:57,420
If you learn it, when you really learn it,

1161
01:37:57,548 --> 01:37:59,892
you begin to perceive time
the way that they do,

1162
01:37:59,951 --> 01:38:02,989
so you can see what's to come.

1163
01:38:03,087 --> 01:38:05,089
But time, it isn't the same for them.

1164
01:38:05,223 --> 01:38:07,430
It's non-linear.

1165
01:38:07,558 --> 01:38:10,095
Look, we did our best,
but it wasn't enough.

1166
01:38:11,396 --> 01:38:12,773
The captain will load you up.

1167
01:38:12,897 --> 01:38:14,467
You're lifting off in 5 minutes.

1168
01:38:14,565 --> 01:38:18,672
Ian, Louise, it was
an honor to work with you.

1169
01:38:18,770 --> 01:38:20,807
Good luck.

1170
01:38:24,409 --> 01:38:26,252
Hey, Colonel...

1171
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:35,128
I'm gonna find out where we're going.

1172
01:38:42,627 --> 01:38:44,766
Wake up, Mommy!

1173
01:39:20,298 --> 01:39:22,005
Dr. Banks...

1174
01:39:23,201 --> 01:39:24,874
A pleasure.

1175
01:39:24,969 --> 01:39:28,644
General Shang,
the pleasure is mine, really.

1176
01:39:28,706 --> 01:39:30,743
Your president said

1177
01:39:30,842 --> 01:39:34,051
he was honored to host me
at the celebration...

1178
01:39:34,145 --> 01:39:35,818
Yeah.

1179
01:39:35,913 --> 01:39:38,917
But I confess,
the only reason why I'm here

1180
01:39:39,016 --> 01:39:42,657
is to meet you in person.

1181
01:39:44,021 --> 01:39:47,093
Me? Well, I'm flattered. Thank you.

1182
01:39:47,658 --> 01:39:50,002
18 months ago,

1183
01:39:50,094 --> 01:39:52,665
you did something remarkable,

1184
01:39:52,764 --> 01:39:56,769
something not even
my superior has done.

1185
01:39:58,169 --> 01:39:59,773
And what's that?

1186
01:39:59,904 --> 01:40:01,542
You changed my mind.

1187
01:40:03,708 --> 01:40:07,884
You're the reason for this unification,

1188
01:40:08,379 --> 01:40:12,350
all because you reached out to me
at my private number.

1189
01:40:14,352 --> 01:40:16,559
Your private number?

1190
01:40:16,687 --> 01:40:19,031
General, I... I don't know
your private number.

1191
01:40:25,229 --> 01:40:26,970
Now you know.

1192
01:40:28,466 --> 01:40:31,709
I do not claim to know
how your mind works,

1193
01:40:31,803 --> 01:40:36,548
but I believe it was important
for you to see that.

1194
01:40:38,309 --> 01:40:40,050
I called you, didn't I'?

1195
01:40:41,212 --> 01:40:43,556
Yes, you did.

1196
01:40:54,392 --> 01:40:55,996
Louise!

1197
01:41:12,243 --> 01:41:14,951
All right,
let's shut down the system.

1198
01:41:15,079 --> 01:41:18,754
Sir'? There's a sat line
here dialing China.

1199
01:41:20,585 --> 01:41:22,587
Here? What do you mean "here"?

1200
01:41:24,755 --> 01:41:26,996
Come on, come on!

1201
01:41:27,091 --> 01:41:29,093
Whose phone is it?

1202
01:41:33,097 --> 01:41:34,701
It's your phone' sir.

1203
01:41:41,973 --> 01:41:43,475
Search base camp now.

1204
01:41:43,608 --> 01:41:45,815
Find out who's using that phone.

1205
01:41:45,943 --> 01:41:47,616
And hold on to those coordinates.

1206
01:41:47,712 --> 01:41:48,816
YES, sir.

1207
01:41:48,946 --> 01:41:51,153
Come on... What do I say?

1208
01:41:52,149 --> 01:41:53,787
What do I say?

1209
01:42:04,629 --> 01:42:06,165
Come on.

1210
01:42:06,831 --> 01:42:09,869
I will never forget what you said.

1211
01:42:20,511 --> 01:42:24,220
You told me my wife's dying words.

1212
01:42:40,998 --> 01:42:42,809
We found the source
of the phone call.

1213
01:42:42,833 --> 01:42:44,993
It's in the clean room.
We're waiting for instructions.

1214
01:42:48,039 --> 01:42:49,848
What are you doing?

1215
01:42:49,941 --> 01:42:52,012
- What are you doing?
- Changing someone's mind.

1216
01:42:52,109 --> 01:42:54,087
- Can you buy me 20 seconds?
- We don't have time for this.

1217
01:42:54,111 --> 01:42:55,522
No, trust me. Buy me 20 seconds.

1218
01:42:55,613 --> 01:42:57,615
- Do you trust me?
- Okay. Yeah.

1219
01:43:00,885 --> 01:43:04,526
Dr. Banks, drop the phone
now or we shoot!

1220
01:43:07,858 --> 01:43:09,030
Drop it!

1221
01:43:09,126 --> 01:43:10,230
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

1222
01:43:11,896 --> 01:43:14,740
You are committing
an act of treason!

1223
01:43:19,870 --> 01:43:21,907
- Yes.
- Drop it!

1224
01:43:21,973 --> 01:43:23,611
It's done. I'm done.

1225

are sifting through information</i>

1238
01:44:07,652 --> 01:44:09,097
<i>received from the UK, Japan,</i>

1239
01:44:09,153 --> 01:44:10,496
<i>Sierra Leone and Venezuela.</i>

1240
01:44:10,588 --> 01:44:12,499
<i>The information they have acquired</i>

1241
01:44:12,590 --> 01:44:14,297
<i>from both of their landing sites...</i>

1242
01:44:14,358 --> 01:44:16,531
<i>Also confirming it to be
one of the 12 pieces</i>

1243
01:44:16,627 --> 01:44:18,971
<i>of this puzzle that is
being slowly put together.</i>

1244
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:10,583
<i>So, Hannah,</i>

1245
01:46:12,143 --> 01:46:14,817
<i>this is where your story begins.</i>

1246
01:46:16,814 --> 01:46:18,953
<i>The day they departed.</i>

1247
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:24,490
You all right?

1248
01:46:27,658 --> 01:46:32,266
<i>Despite knowing the journey
and where it leads,</i>

1249
01:46:35,099 --> 01:46:37,136
<i>I embrace it.</i>

1250
01:46:38,969 --> 01:46:42,439
<i>And I welcome every moment of it.</i>

1251
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:46,580
Ooh! Ah! Ooh!

1252
01:46:57,321 --> 01:47:01,827
H-A-N-N-A-H.

1253
01:47:15,706 --> 01:47:18,312
Now backward. H...

1254
01:47:18,442 --> 01:47:21,013
H-A-N-N-A-H!

1255
01:47:21,111 --> 01:47:22,522
Hannah!

1256
01:47:22,613 --> 01:47:24,615
You ready, baby?

1257
01:47:27,351 --> 01:47:28,853
Hi!

1258
01:47:31,455 --> 01:47:33,526
Don't worry. See you.

1259
01:47:35,125 --> 01:47:36,627
Daddy!

1260
01:47:45,803 --> 01:47:47,305
You okay?

1261
01:47:51,809 --> 01:47:53,584
Are you ready?

1262
01:47:57,081 --> 01:47:58,822
Oh, guess what? Star stuff!

1263
01:48:01,385 --> 01:48:03,831
- Ian'?
- Yeah?

1264
01:48:03,921 --> 01:48:07,562
If you could see your whole life
from start to finish,

1265
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:11,831
would you change things?

1266
01:48:17,902 --> 01:48:21,907
Maybe I'd say
what I feel more often.

1267
01:48:22,006 --> 01:48:23,610
I... I don't know.

1268
01:48:39,189 --> 01:48:41,760
You know, I've had my head
tilted up to the stars

1269
01:48:41,859 --> 01:48:43,429
for as long as I can remember.

1270
01:48:45,930 --> 01:48:48,467
You know what surprised me the most?

1271
01:48:50,267 --> 01:48:52,372
It wasn't meeting them.

1272
01:48:57,141 --> 01:48:59,382
It was meeting you.

1273
01:49:39,350 --> 01:49:43,196
I forgot how good it
felt to be held by you.

1274
01:49:52,262 --> 01:49:54,264
You wanna make a baby?

1275
01:50:28,499 --> 01:50:31,139
Yes. Yeah.
