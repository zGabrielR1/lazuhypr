1
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,491
My lords and ladies!

2
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:32,224
Today, your Queen will
choose her champion.

3
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:36,362
Here he will battle
for not only her honor,

4
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,070
but for a title of his own.

5
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:45,345
But only if he can defeat
the Captain of my Guard,

6
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,445
Sir Horace the Black!

7
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,819
Sir William, wouldst
thou fight for my honor?

8
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,922
To the death, Your Majesty.

9
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,496
Let's hope it does
not come to that, eh?

10
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:12,238
I choose Sir William
as my champion.

11
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,971
Attack from his left side.

12
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:23,017
I saw his squire bandaging
that shoulder this morning.

13
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,283
I wish thee luck and strength.

14
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:32,019
I fear I shall
need all I can get.

15
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:42,429
The Captain of my Guard,
Sir Horace the Black!

16
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:04,181
Are you sure you wouldn't like to
reconsider your choice, my Queen?

17
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,687
I believe I chose
rightly, my King.

18
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:21,031
Brave knights, in the honored
tradition of our land, have at ye!

19
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:52,167
I fear you chose
most poorly, my love.

20
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,034
William! William!
William! William!

21
00:03:56,136 --> 00:04:00,597
William! William!
William! William!

22
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:04,202
William! William!
William! William!

23
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,770
William? What is it?

24
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,753
Your eyes.

25
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,323
William.

26
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:38,139
We need an ambulance
at the Camden Fairgrounds.

27
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,937
You're new.

28
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,863
You're naked.

29
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,876
And for the record,
a little bit cold.

30
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,037
I'm sorry, I didn't know
that anyone was home.

31
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,513
James had an early call,
and I was just leaving.

32
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,348
Without breakfast?

33
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,080
I'm fine, thanks.
I'm Sam, by the way.

34
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,181
House. Nice to meet you.

35
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,781
It'd be nicer if
you put this on.

36
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,087
So you and Wilson...

37
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,322
Thought you were staying
in New York last night.

38
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,834
Sorry, must have missed the "if
this trailer be a-rocking" sign out front.

39
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,436
I'm really late, so...

40
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:15,838
If there's any chance that we
can pretend this never happened,

41
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,771
I'd be completely
fine with that.

42
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,455
An eight-year-old
with bleeding ears.

43
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:34,722
I'll see your bleeding ears and raise
you a total muscular degeneration.

44
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,057
What the hell?

45
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,694
I had a dream like this
once. It didn't end well.

46
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,973
Huzzah, my loyal peasants.

47
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,337
House, what are you doing?

48
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,002
Filling in for Rabbi Shmuhl
at the Goldstein Bris.

49
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:55,244
While I'm busy, you all can check
out the knight down in the ER,

50
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,375
who instead of seizing
the throne, just seized.

51
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,215
He works at a
Renaissance festival?

52
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,722
Doesn't work
there, he lives there.

53
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,054
He's part of a
wonderful little troupe

54
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,594
who spend their weekends
re-enacting a nobler age

55
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:10,640
when people crapped in the streets and
Thirteen would've been a grandmother.

56
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:13,793
Weeks, not weekends. Says here
he's been camping out for a month.

57
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:19,796
Try doing that with a pen.

58
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,502
Why don't you put that down
before you kill one of us?

59
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,942
Better idea. Why don't you
give me something I can use

60
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,131
so I won't feel the need to?

61
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,513
Seizure right after a fight
obviously suggests concussion.

62
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,416
Obviously it isn't, or the ER
wouldn't have called House.

63
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,080
A full suit of armor would
protect against visible trauma,

64
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,714
but not transmitted
concussive force.

65
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,157
Could be a subdural hematoma.

66
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,558
You're forgetting to demonize.

67
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,493
An evil, satanic
subdural hematoma.

68
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:49,229
No, two demon eyes.
Hemorrhaging in the sclerae.

69
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,747
Could be an allergic reaction to
something from the Renaissance fair.

70
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,672
Which is why we need
to check out Middle Earth.

71
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,209
Foreman, take Frodo and
break bread with the Hobbits.

72
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,753
I still think a hematoma
is more likely.

73
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,508
That's why you and Chase
are gonna get an MRI.

74
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,604
But you just...

75
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,513
I said Frodo, not Gollum.

76
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,882
Is he saying I have
short legs or hairy feet?

77
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,479
I don't even know who Frodo is.

78
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,152
Who's the chick, and
why are you hiding her?

79
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,993
You were home last night?

80
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:21,728
And this morning. I bumped
into your babe naked.

81
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,793
I told you to stay
out of my bathroom.

82
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,997
I was in the kitchen.

83
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,972
She was naked in the
kitchen? I was naked.

84
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,250
Why were you
naked in the kitchen?

85
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,485
That's not important right now.

86
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,308
What is, is why you didn't want
me to meet her in the first place.

87
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,109
Is she married? No.

88
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,307
Patient?

89
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:36,645
I don't have time for this.

90
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,378
She used to be a man. House!

91
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,976
She wants to be a man.

92
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:43,581
Sam is a man's
name, short for...

93
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,560
Samantha.

94
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,266
The soulless harpy you
were married to before we met.

95
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,894
People change, House.

96
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:01,772
Sure. They get older,
their ovaries start drying up

97
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,605
and nice guys like you
look attractive again.

98
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,838
Listen, I know that in
your own demented way,

99
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,992
you think you're looking
out for me. But I have this.

100
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:12,179
By "this" you mean a sinking
feeling in the pit of the stomach.

101
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:14,016
Fine, I get it.

102
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:17,023
It's your life, you go
screw it up. I can wait.

103
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,422
For what?

104
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,823
To tell you, "I told you so."

105
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:30,362
No signs of a hematoma.
Brain looks completely normal.

106
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:34,272
Normal, except for the fact
that he likes to play dress-up.

107
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,033
My uncle used to pretend
that he was King Leopold.

108
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,908
<i>I'm not pretending.</i>

109
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,412
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

110
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,085
<i>But you don't really think
you're a knight, do you?</i>

111
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:52,250
Being a knight isn't
a game, it's a lifestyle,

112
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,420
<i>and we do it every day, not
just when we play dress-up.</i>

113
00:09:55,495 --> 00:10:01,594
<i>We live by a code, and uphold
ideals like loyalty, courage, humility.</i>

114
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:05,400
And the part where you beat the
crap out of each other in armor?

115
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:09,270
<i>That we do for fun. At least
it was up until yesterday.</i>

116
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,769
<i>Are we almost
done? I'm feeling...</i>

117
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,774
Let's get him out of
there before he aspirates.

118
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,191
Anything abnormal on the MRI?

119
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:34,998
God's teeth! What strange
manner of garments be these?

120
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:37,237
Okay. We'll be back soon.

121
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:41,604
He consorts with tiny demons
in his hand. 'Tis witchcraft, I say.

122
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,269
Do I look like I'm here
to play pretend with you?

123
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,638
Relax. It's not personal.

124
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,651
Just tell them you're a
time traveler or something.

125
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,150
Well, if we're gonna be
here, we might as well enjoy it.

126
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,314
Our knight just
vomited inside the MRI.

127
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,188
Taub thinks it might
be food poisoning.

128
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,688
Which shouldn't be surprising.

129
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:09,792
Outdoor latrines, food prep
going on next to livestock.

130
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:17,202
I hear you wish to speak
with me concerning Sir William.

131
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,336
How faireth he?

132
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,676
Not well, or we
wouldn't be here.

133
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,609
A pox indeed is... Miles.

134
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,948
We just thought it
was a concussion.

135
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,488
He's going to be okay, right?

136
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:31,491
We need to look at the
area he was camping out in.

137
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,892
And you might want to invest
into a dental plan for the kingdom.

138
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,788
You sure he got sick
from something here?

139
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,460
I'm not sure of
anything, yet, but...

140
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,530
What do you make of this?

141
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,768
Mmm. Looks like vomit.

142
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,143
Means he was showing
symptoms prior to the fight.

143
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,513
True, but I meant this.

144
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:01,514
Oh. It's a cow eye from the
night before the tournament.

145
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:04,490
He makes the knights eat
all kinds of disgusting stuff.

146
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:05,684
Why?

147
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,124
Got the idea from <i>Fear Factor.</i>

148
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,238
Why didn't he mention it when
he checked into the hospital?

149
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,788
I make them all take an oath
of secrecy about the ritual.

150
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,857
William tends to take his
role as a knight very seriously.

151
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,963
You think that's what
caused him to pass out?

152
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,304
It's not exactly sanitary.

153
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,872
Fun stuff never is.

154
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:36,720
Serious bacterial food poisoning
explains seizure and vomiting.

155
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,087
A lumbar puncture could confirm.

156
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,750
Except it's not food poisoning.

157
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:43,228
If it was, the ER would
look like Camelot right now.

158
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,390
All it takes is one bad eyeball.

159
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:49,527
Or testicle, cow brain,
or my personal favorite,

160
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:53,334
pig rectum with a
side order of sphincter.

161
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,773
I think they call that
breakfast in Australia.

162
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,554
No one else was sick because
they weren't allergic like he was.

163
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,444
To what? That's what I
sent you to Middle Earth

164
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,776
to find out.

165
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,116
Run scratch tests with the
samples you brought back.

166
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,962
That's gonna take time,
and he's getting worse.

167
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,455
So treat him with
epinephrine, too.

168
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,008
This should prevent
any more symptoms

169
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,365
until we can figure out
what it is you're allergic to.

170
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:22,732
Thanks.

171
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,533
I told you, you shouldn't
have eaten all that stuff.

172
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:26,682
You know, you
don't have to stay.

173
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,767
I'm sure you and Miles are crazy
busy, what with the wedding and all.

174
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,708
Miles said we could
postpone it until...

175
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,839
Don't worry, I'll be fine. I'll be there. I
just hope you have a good photographer.

176
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,975
'Cause I don't think the standard
red-eye filter's going to work on these.

177
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:40,486
I need your right arm.

178
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:52,163
That feels... Feels strange.

179
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,157
What is it? What's wrong?

180
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,066
His heart rate's
become irregular.

181
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,397
My chest hurts. It feels
like it's going to explode.

182
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,737
Tachycardia. We need to
shock him back into rhythm.

183
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,104
Oh, my God, William...

184
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,008
I need his gown open.

185
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,306
What is that?
What is that stuff?

186
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,508
I don't know.

187
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,425
It's definitely not an allergy,

188
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,656
or the epi would have helped
him, not made him worse.

189
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:28,725
Unless he's allergic and allergic
to the cure. Sodium bisulfite,

190
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:32,363
the preservative that keeps epi
peppy, can cause tachycardia.

191
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,498
So can Wolff-Parkinson-
White syndrome,

192
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,600
and it also causes
hemorrhaging in the eyes.

193
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:39,612
And abnormal electrical pathways in
the heart, which could cause seizures.

194
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,910
But not skin infections.

195
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,576
There is an infection that can
cause skin and neurological damage

196
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,710
and spreads rapidly
without treatment.

197
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:49,847
Methicillin-resistant
staphylococcus aureus?

198
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,448
Lord have MRSA.

199
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:56,428
You weren't wearing gloves when
we shocked his heart back into rhythm.

200
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:03,300
I'm sure you'll be fine. You two,
get a sample to the lab to confirm.

201
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,430
You get the knight into
isolation and on IV antibiotics.

202
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,531
You, stay away from me.

203
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,884
Need to talk. About the MRSA?

204
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,943
I know. We're... MRSA, shmrsa.

205
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,385
Something important.

206
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:25,448
Something you think is more important
than a potentially lethal bacteria

207
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,289
spreading like wildfire
through my hospital?

208
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:32,092
Well, that narrows it down to
something personal and stupid.

209
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,390
Wilson. Theory confirmed.

210
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,663
He is dating his
first wife, I know.

211
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,164
I don't believe it.

212
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,004
That he didn't ask
your permission first?

213
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,908
No, that he's actually capable
of keeping a secret from me.

214
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:48,106
Well, you'd be surprised how
many things Wilson doesn't tell you.

215
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:52,915
Would I? Like how you slept
with your father's best friend? Or...

216
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,078
I'm going to kill him.

217
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,712
You need to break them up.

218
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:57,548
Forget it.

219
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,023
So you'd rather
sit back and watch

220
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,391
while the evil blonde gorges
on Wilson's tender flesh

221
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,591
and then tosses out his
bones like she did the last time?

222
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,633
You remember what
he was like after that?

223
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,229
Yes, I do.

224
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,465
Well, then do something.

225
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,053
God knows he's not
gonna listen to me.

226
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,804
You, on the other hand, have
decades of experience dating

227
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,243
and being attracted to losers.

228
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,438
Obviously I don't
include myself.

229
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,093
You know what happens when you
interfere in other people's relationships?

230
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,552
Of course, I do it all the time.

231
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,245
Hmm. I see your point.

232
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,519
That is why I'm
staying out of this.

233
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:36,726
You force him to choose,
you might not like the answer.

234
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,934
He doesn't seem to be
in as much pain any more.

235
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,133
That's good.

236
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:52,701
But we won't be out of the woods for
sure until the blisters start to recede.

237
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,942
I'm really thirsty. You
mind getting me a soda?

238
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,108
Sure. I'll be right back.

239
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,879
What's wrong?

240
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,756
The pain in my chest,
it's getting worse.

241
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,384
Just now? No.

242
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:12,091
I didn't want to worry her.

243
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,344
So how long have you
been in love with her?

244
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,837
What? No, we're just friends.

245
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,733
Seriously.

246
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,377
Since the first time I saw her.

247
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,208
Why don't you tell her?

248
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,575
She's engaged to my friend.

249
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:29,809
The King?

250
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,283
Haven't seen him visiting
or sitting by your bedside.

251
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,910
He has responsibilities.

252
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,683
Yeah? I'm guessing
the Queen does, too.

253
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:40,193
What kind of knight
steals his friend's bride?

254
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:43,687
I hate that I even
think about it.

255
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,595
You're not a knight.
You're just a guy.

256
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,871
But I want to be more than that.

257
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,441
Your chest?

258
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,876
No, my back.

259
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:01,312
Feels like there's
a knife in it.

260
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,146
Is the infection spreading?

261
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,445
<i>It's not MRSA.</i>

262
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,751
It looks like some sort
of clostridial organism.

263
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:13,823
Question is, which type of
clostridium? There's hundreds.

264
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,653
C. perfringens?

265
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,763
Wouldn't account for his other
symptoms. C. tetani, on the other hand?

266
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,334
Tetanus? He would have
been inoculated against it.

267
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,768
So he cut himself and
didn't get a booster shot.

268
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,932
The guy fights people with swords
for fun, no one said he's smart.

269
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,669
They don't just fight for fun.

270
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,371
They fight to
prove their bravery.

271
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,673
You buying this honor stuff?

272
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,618
Fighting is not
brave, it's just stupid.

273
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,517
You would say that.

274
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,799
You think I've never
been in a fight?

275
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,314
No, I just think
you've never won one.

276
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,826
I took on three
guys in college once.

277
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,953
Hope they bought
you dinner first.

278
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,092
It's not MRSA. I know.

279
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,723
- It's poison ivy.
- Poison ivy?

280
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,268
A severe reaction
could cause the blisters

281
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,770
and maybe irritate his eyes
enough to cause the hemorrhaging,

282
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,966
but the chest pain and seizures?

283
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,805
They have bonfires every night.

284
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,844
Burning leaves
aerosolizes the oil.

285
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,989
You've seen what it's done
to the outside of his body,

286
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:09,244
imagine what it's doing to
his lungs and his sinuses.

287
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,011
Okay, maybe it remotely fits,

288
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,643
but I'd rather go with scientific
evidence than with your gut.

289
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,679
How about this?

290
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,084
Apparently, it's
all over his sword.

291
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,930
It's his heart rate again!

292
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:26,642
How fast is it? It's
slowing. Why aren't you...

293
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,191
It's not MRSA.

294
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,962
I'm giving him 12
cc's of epinephrine.

295
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,971
He tested positive.
You'll blow his heart out.

296
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,906
If it slows any more,
it's going to stop.

297
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,543
I told you!

298
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,410
And I told you.

299
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,924
That wasn't caused
by poison ivy.

300
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,188
Or epinephrine.

301
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:59,630
Means the heart problem we ruled
out, we now have to rule back in.

302
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:02,258
We found clostridium
bacteria in the skin samples.

303
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,599
Clostridium's in dirt
and basically harmless.

304
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,367
But opportunistic, if his
immune system was depressed.

305
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,238
Leukemia? He
would've had symptoms

306
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,867
way before the
Renaissance festival.

307
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:14,277
Which is true of anything that would
compromise his immune system.

308
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,714
Which means it has to be
some other environmental toxin.

309
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,810
Yesterday he was a healthy
knight, today he's sleeping beauty.

310
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,149
Nothing else fits.

311
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,052
Trichinosis from
eating infected meat?

312
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,434
We already ruled
out food poisoning.

313
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,338
Both the butcher shop and the food
stands at the fair were totally clean.

314
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,427
Then he ate the poison
apple somewhere else,

315
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,561
or maybe you just missed it.

316
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,001
Start treatment for trichinosis
and confirm with a muscle biopsy.

317
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,137
Hey.

318
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,448
I can't believe I'm
about to say this. Sam...

319
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,075
Told you so.

320
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:55,952
No, she didn't dump me. She
wants to get to know you better.

321
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,581
Damn it! I never should
have let her see me naked.

322
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,991
It goes against all my
instincts, but I said all right.

323
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,154
Why?

324
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,130
She thinks I was
hiding her from you.

325
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,255
You were.

326
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:07,664
I don't want her to know.

327
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:12,635
You're asking me to condone a
relationship based on lies and mistrust?

328
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,305
Yeah.

329
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:16,431
When and where?

330
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,307
Tonight. Venezia. 8:00.

331
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,521
What am I gonna wear?

332
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,207
All my cereal boxes
are at the cleaners.

333
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,277
House, listen.

334
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,912
I know you're worried about me.

335
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,750
And I also know that
that kind of unselfishness

336
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,155
doesn't come naturally to you.

337
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:35,391
But I don't want your
help. I don't need your help.

338
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:40,959
Just come to dinner and
be your usual selfish self.

339
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,333
How could I say no?

340
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,543
Miles said he'd stop by later.

341
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,374
Tell him not to.

342
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,541
I don't want to
be seen like this.

343
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,876
You're sick. That's
nothing to be ashamed of.

344
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,958
Unless you're saying
you want me to leave?

345
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,318
No, don't.

346
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:07,249
I think he's saying it's
different with you, Shannon.

347
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,071
It's a guy thing. They don't like
showing weakness in front of each other.

348
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,688
Right, William?

349
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,990
Right. Maybe when
I'm feeling a little better.

350
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:21,237
I'm going to take a small
sample of your muscle tissue here.

351
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,813
Do you mind waiting
outside for this?

352
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,036
Don't hurt him.

353
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,873
He's safe with me.

354
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,690
I thought you were
going to tell her.

355
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:36,682
Not my call, but if you ask
me, she's waiting for you to.

356
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:39,482
Knights are supposed
to be selfless.

357
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:44,022
Right, they conquered countries
and built castles by being selfless.

358
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,562
Bravery and loyalty are
great qualities for soldiers.

359
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:51,468
If you want to be king, sometimes you
have to be willing to take what's yours.

360
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:57,705
She's not mine.

361
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,306
She's not his either. Not yet.

362
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:12,582
It's just dinner. Relax.

363
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,251
Trust me, there is no "just"
when House is involved.

364
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:17,057
We're in the middle
of a restaurant.

365
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:20,258
What could he possibly do?

366
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:23,595
That.

367
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:29,105
Sorry we're late,
but you know girls.

368
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,166
Always fiddling with
the hair and the makeup.

369
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,944
James, Sam, this is Sarah.

370
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,657
It's nice to meet you.
Horace has told me...

371
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:36,705
House.

372
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:40,412
House has told me all about you.

373
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,782
Nice to meet you.

374
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,860
What's the diagnosis?

375
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:53,426
His muscle biopsy's
clean. It's not trichinosis.

376
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,625
House was wrong. This
is not environmental.

377
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,899
Or we screwed up and missed
something at the Renaissance fair.

378
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:01,099
You think we did?

379
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,836
No, but I think House
will think we did.

380
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:06,237
What could we have missed?

381
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:08,275
Fungal infection?

382
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,984
There's nothing in his blood
work even remotely suggesting that.

383
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:14,179
But it fits the symptoms.

384
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:17,155
You want to retest every
sample we took for spores?

385
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:19,787
We'll be here all night.

386
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,884
Have you noticed how
much pain he's been in lately?

387
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:24,124
And that's relevant how?

388
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:28,031
Extra pain means extra
cranky, means off his game.

389
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,262
He's not gonna accept
this isn't environmental

390
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,668
unless we give him no choice.

391
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,812
I cannot believe you're
from Bloomington.

392
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,714
I know. Isn't it amazing?

393
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,377
Yeah. Delightful.

394
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:49,547
Ignore him. He's just
upset that we're having fun.

395
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,333
Do you remember
that little bakery,

396
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:53,690
the one with the
amazing cupcakes?

397
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,227
Gino's. Oh, yes!

398
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:56,574
First stop every time I go home.

399
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,096
Me, too.

400
00:24:58,464 --> 00:24:59,693
Remember that strip club?

401
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:02,735
Girl, I used to work
at that strip club.

402
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:08,683
Where does it hurt, William?

403
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,573
My legs. It feels
like they're on fire.

404
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:27,791
Rhabdomyolysis means
his kidneys are failing.

405
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:31,022
Also means it's not
environmental. We need to move on.

406
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,842
I recommend we start with a full
cancer work-up, starting with the...

407
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,165
Which one of you
checked out the apartment?

408
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:37,259
House...

409
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:38,580
His symptoms fit
an environmental...

410
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:40,163
The test results
don't. We redid...

411
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,071
Search the apartment.

412
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,385
He hasn't been
there in three weeks.

413
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:45,310
Go! Now!

414
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,347
I liked him better when
he was on Vicodin.

415
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:52,976
You and Thirteen
check out his place.

416
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:55,230
While you're wasting your
time, we'll ultrasound the liver.

417
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:58,588
If it's cancer, it's as good
a place as any to start.

418
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:04,728
Hey. Hey.

419
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,671
Heard House met Sam.

420
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,692
The first time he was naked.

421
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,574
The second time, he brought a
transvestite prostitute to dinner.

422
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,611
Overall, it could've been worse.

423
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,274
Great.

424
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,646
That's your reaction?

425
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:26,810
What?

426
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,945
Nudity, prostitutes...

427
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,686
Sorry. Preoccupied.

428
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,718
House said something
to you, didn't he?

429
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,390
No. He didn't.

430
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,805
It is a little crazy,
though. I mean, isn't it?

431
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,343
I mean, things seem
to be going great,

432
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:58,248
but they seemed to be
going great 12 years ago.

433
00:26:58,317 --> 00:26:59,842
The good things are still good.

434
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,183
She's still smart,
funny, gets me.

435
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:03,483
And she's less competitive.

436
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:07,057
Either she's changed or
I've changed, but either way...

437
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:10,020
Am I out of my mind?

438
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:16,063
You never know what can happen.

439
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,694
Might as well give it a chance.

440
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:23,935
Yeah.

441
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,611
Looks like you were right.

442
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:33,610
Tumors, dozens of them
inside and on the surface.

443
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,680
Pull in closer.

444
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,160
See that?

445
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:47,022
What is that?

446
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,794
I don't know, but it's
definitely not cancer.

447
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:07,979
Kitchen's clean.

448
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:09,850
Bedroom as well.

449
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:13,017
Most dangerous thing in his
medicine cabinet was dental floss.

450
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,518
It's locked. Key
wasn't on his ring.

451
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,258
You honestly want to go back

452
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,494
and tell House we didn't check
every square inch of this place?

453
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,092
Of course not.

454
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:40,883
My hero.

455
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,698
What the hell is this?

456
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:58,599
Either a secret
entrance to Hogwarts

457
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:03,868
or our knight is a witch.

458
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,950
Our knight is into some
seriously creepy stuff.

459
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,357
He claims it's just sugar water,

460
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,238
but we sent the rest
down to the lab for testing.

461
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,462
You think he poisoned himself?

462
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,008
It's not poison. We would have
picked it up in his blood work.

463
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:29,092
Not if it collected
slowly in his liver

464
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:31,864
and it all started leaking
into his system at once.

465
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,133
These tumors that aren't tumors,

466
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,470
what if they're focal hepatic
lesions filled with blood?

467
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:39,977
Every time one explodes,
it'd be releasing another dose.

468
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,376
Of what?

469
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,977
<i>Plumbum nigrum.</i>

470
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,417
You putting a hex on someone?

471
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:50,217
It's Latin for black lead.

472
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:54,522
Our knight/warlock apparently
also dabbles in alchemy.

473
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,659
Lead poisoning?

474
00:29:56,762 --> 00:30:00,096
Seizures, paralysis, weak immune
system and eventually coma.

475
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:03,067
Biopsy the cysts,
you'll find your lead.

476
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:12,374
You think we'll make the 7:30?

477
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:15,437
I'm sorry. If I don't change, I'm
gonna feel like I'm at work all night.

478
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:16,914
Yeah, I remember.

479
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,041
Is it a problem?

480
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:19,783
Not at all.

481
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:23,684
In fact, if we hurry...

482
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,825
We will definitely
not make the 7:30.

483
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:30,795
Well, there's always the 9:40.

484
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,202
Or not.

485
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,608
Shouldn't you be
at the hospital?

486
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,490
Wouldn't need a team if I
did all the work, now, would I?

487
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:55,730
Plus, I had to make you dinner.

488
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:56,754
We have plans.

489
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,714
Bet your plans
don't taste like this.

490
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,488
Don't!

491
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:06,629
House, whatever it
is that you're up to...

492
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:09,233
I'm trying to be nice.

493
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:16,006
What I did the other night
was juvenile. I'm sorry.

494
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:31,548
Yeah.

495
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:32,886
Soufflé was amazing.

496
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:36,192
It's my mom's recipe.
Everything else, I got off the web.

497
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,289
Here's to the Internet.

498
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,855
Where I found the lamb ragù

499
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:43,458
and you two found
each other. Again.

500
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:45,663
Well, it wasn't
just the Internet.

501
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:48,969
Yeah, more like
divorce, depression,

502
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,975
therapy, more therapy,
then the Internet.

503
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,135
Yeah.

504
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,504
And here we are.

505
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,604
Exactly. And here we are.

506
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:03,155
Well, I need to go
to the bathroom.

507
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:06,384
I think you're old enough now, but if
you'd like me to come along with you...

508
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:09,394
I mean, is it safe to
leave the two of you?

509
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:11,020
Come on, James, enough already.

510
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,565
Yeah, James. I cook in peace.

511
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,333
Okay. Be right back.

512
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:29,510
You're a cold-hearted bitch
who ripped his heart out.

513
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:32,845
I watched him struggle for years
to overcome the damage you did,

514
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:35,217
and there's no way I'm just
gonna let you reel him back in

515
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,620
so you can do it all over again.

516
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:43,685
And all this?

517
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,094
Phase two of getting
to know my enemy.

518
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,325
You're wrong about me.

519
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:54,268
But I'm glad now I don't
have to pretend I like you,

520
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,535
except for when James
is standing next to me.

521
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,643
Same here. The only
difference is, I'll outlast you.

522
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:05,415
And scene.

523
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:10,551
Well, it's too late
for the movie.

524
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:11,783
Wanna see what's on TV?

525
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,085
Absolutely.

526
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,123
Love to.

527
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,234
There wasn't any lead present
in his blood work or liver biopsy.

528
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,381
And his heart rate and BP
are getting even more erratic.

529
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:31,240
We had to shock it back into
rhythm twice during the night.

530
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:37,139
There's only one
thing left to do.

531
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:47,387
We're wasting our time.

532
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,655
Actually, I've already
gotten good value.

533
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,773
I told you there's nothing here that
could've caused any of his symptoms.

534
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,266
No, you told me that you
couldn't find anything here

535
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,511
that could be
causing his symptoms.

536
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,846
And now we're gonna find something
new because we're in costume?

537
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,465
We looked everywhere.
Tested everything.

538
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:05,409
Just because Wilson's acting
stupid doesn't mean we are.

539
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:07,639
You think he's making a mistake?

540
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,773
Of course. But he'll
figure it out sooner or later.

541
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,647
Hopefully after a few
weeks of great sex.

542
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,618
Nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

543
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,278
Wilson's not like us.

544
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,755
He cares too much about
people and their feelings.

545
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:19,916
Thanks for the compliment.

546
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,256
The code that our
knight claims to live by,

547
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:26,628
all that crap about honor and
chivalry, Wilson's naturally like that.

548
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,755
Which is why he is...

549
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,300
A great guy.

550
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:33,133
A sucker and a target.
Someone's got to look out for him.

551
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:36,536
You smell that?

552
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,338
Yeah, it's the apothecary shop,

553
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,845
and, yes, Foreman
and I already...

554
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:51,446
I cry your pardon, sir.

555
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,055
You know what this is?

556
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,150
Why, that's lavender.

557
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:57,695
Try rose hips.

558
00:34:57,963 --> 00:35:00,330
Both harmless. Who cares?

559
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:01,958
It could be cyanide,
as far as he knows.

560
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:05,302
How about this?

561
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,202
Be nothing but St John's wort.

562
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,638
Wrong again. Black Cohosh.

563
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,409
My uncle owns the shop.
I just started apprenticing.

564
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,310
What's the big deal?

565
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:20,211
Hey, I just organized all that.

566
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,523
You know what this is?

567
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,025
A wild carrot?

568
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:32,557
It's hemlock, you
embossed carbuncle.

569
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,991
That's hemlock? You sure?

570
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,229
Did you sell it to anyone?

571
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,664
It's poison. Think hard.

572
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:44,542
It was just one branch.

573
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,139
You sold it to Sir William.

574
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:49,977
No. To the King.

575
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:58,517
It's the only part of the
environment you didn't check.

576
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,455
The people living in it.

577
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,992
What's going on? Why
can't we see William?

578
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:15,165
Because you poisoned
him, your royal anus, with this.

579
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,938
Wild carrots?

580
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,101
Hemlock.

581
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,716
I need to know how much you
used and how you prepared it.

582
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:21,789
You did something to William?

583
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:22,837
No, of course not.

584
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:26,442
He's still alive. You want to avoid
a murder charge, start talking fast.

585
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,511
The apothecary's willing to testify
that you're the only one he gave it to.

586
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,456
Okay. Yeah, maybe I bought
it for the food challenge,

587
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:33,801
but I didn't know
that was hemlock.

588
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,885
If it was for the challenge,

589
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,225
why is Wee Willy the
only knight who's dying?

590
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,296
I don't know.

591
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,993
I'm telling you, I didn't know.
Why would I want to hurt William?

592
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,825
I can think of at
least one reason.

593
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:48,930
Miles, please, whatever
happened, just tell them the truth.

594
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:50,168
I am.

595
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:52,774
I swear.

596
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,576
We ran a gas
chromatography on his blood,

597
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,744
found trace amounts
of piperidine alkaloids.

598
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,419
The main markers of
hemlock intoxication.

599
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,617
Well, the good news is, we
now know what's wrong with you.

600
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:10,395
Bad news is, your king's precious
ideals were just pretend after all.

601
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:13,529
At least when it comes to guys
who get too close to his Queen.

602
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,924
It's not true.

603
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,080
I guess you've never
heard the expression,

604
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,300
"Gas chromatography
machines don't lie."

605
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,204
Neither does Miles.

606
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,572
He's the best knight
I've ever known.

607
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,773
That's why he was chosen king.

608
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:31,714
Miles is a jealous idiot,
and you're just an idiot.

609
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,047
Something's wrong.

610
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:37,419
We performed a gastric lavage
and administered activated charcoal,

611
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,549
but he's getting
worse, not better.

612
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,388
It's been in his
system two days.

613
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,927
We're lucky he's
lasted this long.

614
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:45,259
If it was hemlock, he'd
either be dead already

615
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,474
or getting better
with treatment.

616
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:47,942
It's hemlock. We
found it in his blood.

617
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,110
He may have had some hemlock,

618
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:51,433
but it's not what's killing him.

619
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,675
Don't do it, whatever
you're planning,

620
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,384
especially if you're
gonna use that thing.

621
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:04,140
It was just sitting
in a stone...

622
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:09,617
Here. It's gonna cost extra 'cause
of the level of detail that you wanted.

623
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:13,249
Anything good? And by
good, I, of course, mean bad.

624
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:15,589
Nope. Pretty much
your typical life.

625
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,286
Married young, got divorced.

626
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:19,888
Married a little less
young, got divorced.

627
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,729
She's been pretty successful in
everything she's done except marriage.

628
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,633
Well, there's gotta be
something I can use.

629
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:28,434
Maybe. Didn't read her
shrink's notes. Didn't seem right.

630
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,336
But stealing them did?

631
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,537
Whoa! I didn't steal them. I
found a way to obtain them.

632
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:38,382
Excuse me. I don't mean to
interrupt, but you got a minute?

633
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,811
Sure.

634
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,685
Oh, him? Yeah. I
was just leaving.

635
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,151
Careful, I have a sword.

636
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,090
I don't agree with
what you said,

637
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,794
but I understand
why you said it.

638
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:59,263
We were married young.
We both made mistakes.

639
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,132
And, yes, I did
make most of them.

640
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,108
But that was almost
a decade ago.

641
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:07,941
I'm sorry, is that the statutory
period for soul sucking?

642
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:11,549
I'm not asking you
to like me, House.

643
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,312
To be honest, I
think you're an ass,

644
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:16,252
but we do have one
thing in common.

645
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,220
We care about James.

646
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,124
So prove it and dump him. Again.

647
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,967
You're pretty much insufferable
all the time, aren't you?

648
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:27,056
Sorry. Go on. And yes.

649
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,795
We just reconnected, we have
no idea where we're headed.

650
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:37,441
But is it really too much to ask
that you give us a chance to find out?

651
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,407
I'm sure I'll be
seeing you around.

652
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:21,677
We did it. Well, I did it.

653
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,280
What exactly did we do?

654
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:26,350
You do?

655
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,337
These aren't focal
hepatic lesions on his liver.

656
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:30,658
They're peliosis
hepatis lesions,

657
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:33,994
which, in combination with an
erratic heart rate, usually indicates...

658
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:36,364
Endocarditis, an
infection on his heart valve.

659
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:39,528
Two major symptoms
of anabolic steroid abuse.

660
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:40,730
No, he wouldn't...

661
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,137
And the rhabdo makes the third.

662
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,198
Our patient's a juicer.

663
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:48,070
The ancient poison accelerated
the damage of the modern poison.

664
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:52,144
Start treatment. Let
the king out of the tower.

665
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,619
How are you feeling?

666
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:01,819
Ashamed.

667
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:04,954
You should be.

668
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,925
You'll compromise
your ideals to win a fight,

669
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,696
but not to go for
the woman you love.

670
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:14,470
That was a game, not real life.

671
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:17,698
I didn't...

672
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,767
Hurt anyone? Try
telling that to Shannon.

673
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:23,212
Or maybe I missed something
while she was crying by your bed.

674
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,247
You don't need to
win anyone's heart.

675
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,179
You just need to ask for it.

676
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:41,124
Miles is a great guy.

677
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:43,995
He's rich, smart,
treats her well.

678
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:47,232
She's going to have
a great life with him.

679
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:48,806
With me?

680
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,117
I'd do everything
I could for her,

681
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:51,769
but even at my best,
it wouldn't be much.

682
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:54,711
And she deserves the best.

683
00:41:57,315 --> 00:42:00,979
I guess I'd rather she be
happy, even if it means I'm not.

684
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:07,153
Guess House was
right about that, too.

685
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:08,486
