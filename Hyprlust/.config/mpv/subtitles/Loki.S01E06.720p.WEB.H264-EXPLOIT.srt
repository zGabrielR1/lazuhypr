1
00:00:01,125 --> 00:00:02,916
<i> You weren't born to be king, Loki.</i>

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,583
<i>You were born to cause pain
and suffering and death.</i>

3
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:10,500
<i>The Time-Keepers are all</i>

4
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,625
<i>that stand between us
and full-scale calamity.</i>

5
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,500
<i>- For all time.</i>
<i>- Always.</i>

6
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:16,541
Why am I locked in here?

7
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,625
You were disloyal to the TVA.

8
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:21,267
<i>You were in the Time-Keepers'
chambers. They weren't real.</i>

9
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,916
- And why does that change anything?
- That changes everything!

10
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,059
<i>The nexus event
the two of you caused,</i>

11
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:30,000
whatever that connection is,
can bring this whole place down.

12
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,125
This is new for me. Back on Lamentis...

13
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,041
I can help you if you trust me.

14
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>The person we're after
is beyond The Void at the end of time.</i>

15
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,250
<i>That thing is just their guard dog
protecting the only way in.</i>

16
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,642
- How do we get past the guard dog?
- I'm gonna enchant it.

17
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:50,875
She's pretty confident.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,125
Go!

19
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,250
<i> Way to go, Tic Tac!</i>

20
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,583
<i> That's how you punch.</i>

21
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,892
<i> Wakanda forever!</i>

22
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,226
<i> You haven't heard of me.</i>

23
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,930
<i>- Let me put you on hold.
- Dance-off, bro.</i>

24
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,101
<i>- A friend from work.</i>
<i>- I can do this all day.</i>

25
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,041
<i>- Yeah, I know.</i>
<i>- I'll show you ferocity.</i>

26
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,809
<i>Higher, further, faster, baby.</i>

27
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:34,916
<i> We have a Hulk.</i>

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,851
<i>We're gonna jump on that spaceship
and get out of here. Wanna come?</i>

29
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,208
<i>We think of time
as a one-way motion.</i>

30
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,891
<i>One small step for man...</i>

31
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,250
<i> How dare they!</i>

32
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,660
<i>My dream...</i>

33
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:08,125
<i>We have fought
for the right to experience peace.</i>

34
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,375
<i> Glorious purpose!</i>

35
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,833
<i>Motivated by women
throughout the world.</i>

36
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,756
<i>What is grief,
if not love persevering?</i>

37
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:20,873
<i> I will rise.</i>

38
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,541
<i> Open your eyes.</i>

39
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,541
Aren't you gonna tell me
not to kick the door in?

40
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,083
It never made a difference.

41
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,875
Well, if you think it's a bad idea,
I prefer you to speak your mind.

42
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,500
No. Nothing to say.

43
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,625
That'll be a first.

44
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:57,916
Everything okay?

45
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,250
Yeah. Just need a moment.

46
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,291
Right.

47
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,166
- It's just, you normally...
- Loki, shut up.

48
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,125
I was pruned before you even existed.

49
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,500
I have been waiting for this moment
my entire life.

50
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,333
I just need a second
to get my head straight, okay?

51
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,083
Sure. Of course.

52
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,625
<i>Hey, y'all.</i>

53
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,916
You again?

54
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,791
<i>Welcome to The Citadel at the End of Time.</i>

55
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,375
Come on.

56
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,208
<i>Congratulations.</i>

57
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,250
<i>Y'all had an awfully long journey
to get here.</i>

58
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,791
<i>He's impressed.</i>

59
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,000
Who's impressed?

60
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,625
<i>He Who Remains.</i>

61
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,000
And who is he?

62
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:17,625
<i>He created all and he controls all.</i>

63
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:22,583
<i>At the end, it is only He Who Remains.</i>

64
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,583
<i>And he wants to offer you a deal.</i>

65
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,583
<i>He's been making
a few creative adjustments,</i>

66
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:33,625
<i>and he's worked it out so we can reinsert
both of y'all back into the Timeline</i>

67
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,291
<i>in a way that won't disrupt things.</i>

68
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,583
- "Won't disrupt things"?
<i>- Mmm-hmm.</i>

69
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,458
<i>The TVA can keep doin' its vital work</i>

70
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:45,166
<i>and y'all can live the lives
you've always wanted.</i>

71
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,375
And what have we always wanted?

72
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,791
<i>Now,
don't play coy with me, mister.</i>

73
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,583
<i>You know how you got into this mess.</i>

74
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,916
What?

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,375
<i>The Battle of New York, silly.</i>

76
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:01,708
<i>You versus those self-righteous Avengers.</i>

77
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,750
<i>How would you like to win?</i>

78
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,041
<i>But not just there.</i>

79
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,125
<i>You can kill Thanos.</i>

80
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,958
<i>You want the Infinity Gauntlet? Yours.</i>

81
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,166
<i>Throne of Asgard? No problem.</i>

82
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,583
<i>What about you, missy?</i>

83
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,291
<i>All those years on the run.</i>

84
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,166
<i>Desperate, alone.</i>

85
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:36,291
<i>How would you like to wake up tomorrow
with just a lifetime of happy memories?</i>

86
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,791
<i>Two Lokis in the same place.</i>

87
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,333
Both of us...

88
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,583
together on the Timeline.

89
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,125
<i>It's crazy, but he could make it work.</i>

90
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,250
<i>All of it.</i>

91
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,125
<i>Everything.</i>

92
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,916
<i>Exactly the way you've always wanted.</i>

93
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,625
<i>And you can have it all, together.</i>

94
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,583
It's fiction.

95
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,000
We write our own destiny now.

96
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:17,125
<i>Oh, sure you do. Good luck with that.</i>

97
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,541
Come on.

98
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:40,833
<i>Hey, there.</i>

99
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,791
- What took you so long?
<i>- Sorry.</i>

100
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,625
<i>Some things had to get worked out,</i>

101
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:47,333
<i>but I'm downloadin'
the files you need now.</i>

102
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,375
This isn't what I asked for.

103
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,083
<i>I know, but he thinks
this'll be more useful.</i>

104
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:57,875
Who?

105
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,250
<i>Happy readin'.</i>

106
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,750
He Who Remains.

107
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,250
Not for much longer.

108
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,750
Are we sure he's even still alive?

109
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,541
This is wild.

110
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,125
The two of you...
...same person.

111
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:37,416
I mean, it's a little unnatural. But...

112
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,958
Wow!

113
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,875
Wild.

114
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,583
He Who Remains.

115
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,875
He Who Remains.

116
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,583
She still calls me that?

117
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,041
Creepy, right? But...

118
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500
I like it.

119
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,250
Come on. Come on, let's talk in my office.

120
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,083
Not what you were expecting, hmm?

121
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,416
You're just... a man.

122
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,666
Mmm.

123
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,916
Flesh and blood.

124
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,291
- Don't tell me I'm a disappointment.
- No.

125
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,750
Just a little bit easier to kill.

126
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:53,625
Come on in.

127
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:05,875
One...

128
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,250
Two.

129
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,708
Please, take a seat.

130
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,375
Uh, Loki.

131
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,041
Loki.

132
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,708
Two sugars.

133
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,458
I said I wasn't to be disturbed.

134
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,500
Well, then you're not gonna
be happy to see me.

135
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,000
He's back.

136
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,083
If anyone was ever gonna
make it back from The Void,

137
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,500
I suppose it was gonna be you.

138
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:11,500
Oh, well, you know, one man's Void
is another man's piece of cake.

139
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,291
- So, you're gonna prune me?
- I like that idea.

140
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,583
But, you know, my standards might be a
little bit higher in that area than yours.

141
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,791
- You know, with close personal friends.
- I'm sorry, Mobius.

142
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,083
I couldn't let you get in the way
of our mission.

143
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,166
Mission?

144
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,500
The Time-Keepers are fake.
We're all Variants. What mission?

145
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:36,208
It can't have been for nothing.
That's why I had to prune you.

146
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,333
Hunter D-90 to my office, immediately.

147
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,625
Yeah. Sorry, Ravonna. That's not gonna
work out the way you think it is,

148
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,416
now that we know your secret.

149
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:47,958
What did you do?

150
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,583
Stay alert, she's close.

151
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,041
Secure the perimeter. I've got her.

152
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,083
Stand down, B-15.

153
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,625
You need to listen to me.

154
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,458
- There'll be time for that.
- Just wait.

155
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,250
What the hell is going on here?

156
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,791
Judge Renslayer.

157
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:22,916
What?

158
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,291
Who are you? And what the hell
are you doing in my school?

159
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,958
That isn't Judge Renslayer.

160
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,500
How?

161
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,416
We have a lot to talk about.

162
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,000
Been a long journey for you, hasn't it?

163
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,375
Lot of running, lot of pain.

164
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,666
And you...

165
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,375
You're a flea on the back
of a dragon.

166
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,125
In for one hell of a ride.

167
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,666
But you did manage to hang on.

168
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,000
Mmm-hmm. I guess
that counts for something.

169
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,166
I'm not sure you quite understand
the situation.

170
00:13:58,916 --> 00:13:59,916
You've lost.

171
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,583
We found you.

172
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,750
Duh. Of course you did.

173
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:08,625
Whoa!

174
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,000
A swing and a miss.

175
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,041
So, we're still doing that, hmm?

176
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,250
Let's get all this out of the way.

177
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,541
Okay.

178
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,583
Here we go.

179
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,708
You can't kill me because

180
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,291
I already know what's going to happen.

181
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
See?

182
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,041
It's a parlor trick.

183
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,458
Okay.

184
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:49,916
Don't you wonder how I'm able to get out
of the way just before you kill me?

185
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,708
No. It's because of that little TemPad
you have there.

186
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,791
Right.

187
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:59,500
But how do I already have it loaded up
with everything I need to know

188
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,833
to keep from being killed by you two?

189
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,125
It's easy.

190
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,166
I know it all.

191
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,041
And I've seen it all.

192
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,791
Everything you guys
did on Lamentis, I saw.

193
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:19,208
All the stuff the TVA
didn't know about, I knew.

194
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:23,125
All the scheming, all the...

195
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,000
...talking.

196
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,958
That little look by the lake.

197
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:35,291
Quite sentimental, very touching stuff,
by the way.

198
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,916
No.

199
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,958
No, we broke out of your little game.
That's how we got here.

200
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,833
No, wrong.

201
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:47,958
Every step you took to get here,

202
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,333
Lamentis, The Void,

203
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:55,541
I paved the road.

204
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:58,916
You...

205
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,500
You just walked down it.

206
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,541
And I have the rest,
uh, right here.

207
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,208
Everything that's, uh...

208
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:17,250
that's going to happen.
There's only one way this can go.

209
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,250
Then why are we here?

210
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,583
Oh, come on.

211
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:25,583
You know you can't get to the end
until you've been changed by the journey.

212
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,458
This stuff, it needs to happen.

213
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:34,916
To get us all in the right mindset
to finish the quest.

214
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,166
- Right.
- Right.

215
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,583
So, it's all a game.

216
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,333
It's all... a manipulation.

217
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:47,583
Interesting, that your head
would go to that.

218
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,458
Sylvie,

219
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
you think you can trust this guy?

220
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,750
- Don't listen to him.
- "Don't listen to him."

221
00:16:55,833 --> 00:17:00,666
Do you think you're even capable
of trusting anyone at all?

222
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,875
I think people are ready
to hear a little truth now.

223
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,666
You know, like the TVA is a lie.

224
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,541
But what if it's a necessary one?

225
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,666
Someone created the Time-Keepers.

226
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,583
They created this whole place.
They gave us all purpose.

227
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,875
I have to believe they had a reason.

228
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:24,250
No, because I've seen the horror
waiting for people when they get pruned

229
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,125
and there's nothing necessary
about that.

230
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,125
You know what would happen
if we didn't prune the Timeline?

231
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,125
- What?
- Chaos. Death.

232
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,208
Free will?

233
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,375
Free will?

234
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:38,250
Only one person gets free will.
The one in charge.

235
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:47,208
"Friends across time, allies to the end."

236
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,416
- Shut up.
- That was so beautiful.

237
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,833
And then you sent me to die.
What happened to you?

238
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,333
Nothing, Mobius. I didn't change.

239
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,041
You didn't change? You betrayed me.

240
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,875
No, no. You betrayed me!

241
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,916
I looked out for you,
hung my neck out for you,

242
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,250
and you suffer a crisis of faith
and turn to those Variants?

243
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,625
Eons of friendship.

244
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,916
And you threw it all away
on a couple of Lokis.

245
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,125
No, Mobius. I didn't betray you.

246
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:25,500
We can't take away people's free will,
Ravonna. Do you not see that?

247
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,958
- What are you doing?
- What I need to do.

248
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,791
Wait, stop.

249
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:34,583
Look, maybe we can build this
into something better together.

250
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,791
I'm sorry, Mobius.

251
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,375
I'm not gonna let you go.

252
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,498
Please, Mobius.

253
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,083
Even with that...

254
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,291
you're of no danger to me.

255
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,916
Is that what you think?

256
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:51,875
Let's see.

257
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,541
Yep, you were right.

258
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,958
Back here again.

259
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,541
Go ahead.

260
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,125
Where are you gonna go?

261
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,708
In search of free will.

262
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:35,416
I understand your moral objections
to what the TVA does.

263
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:42,833
And my methods are deceptive.

264
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,416
But the mission, it never was.

265
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:51,583
Without the me, without the TVA...

266
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,625
everything burns.

267
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,333
Then what are you so afraid of?

268
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,416
Me.

269
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,416
And just who are you?

270
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,541
Oh, I've been dubbed many names
by many people.

271
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:24,708
A ruler, a conqueror.

272
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,541
He Who Remains, a jerk.

273
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,916
But it's... it's not as simple as a name.

274
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,708
Eons ago, before the TVA,

275
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:54,000
a variant of myself lived on Earth
in the 31st century.

276
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,500
He was a scientist

277
00:20:56,583 --> 00:21:02,625
and he discovered that there were
universes stacked on top of his own.

278
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:07,000
At the same time, other versions of us
were learning the same thing.

279
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:12,958
Naturally, they made contact.
And for a while, there was peace.

280
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:16,416
Narcissistic, self-congratulatory peace.

281
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,166
"I love your shoes." "I love your hair."
"Oh, man, nice nose." "Thanks, man."

282
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,333
Et cetera.

283
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,250
They shared technology and knowledge.

284
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:30,166
Using the best of their universes
to improve the others.

285
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,541
However...

286
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:38,708
not every version of me

287
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,750
was so... so pure of heart.

288
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:48,583
To some of us,
new worlds meant only one thing,

289
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,708
new lands to be conquered.

290
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,833
The peace between realities...

291
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:02,125
...erupted into all-out war,

292
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:06,500
each variant fighting to preserve
their universe

293
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,500
and annihilate the others.

294
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,125
This was almost the end...

295
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:15,500
...ladies and gentlemen,
of everything and everyone.

296
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,958
And then the Time-Keepers
came along and saved us all.

297
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:26,041
<i>Amen</i>

298
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,791
No. No.

299
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:33,250
Nope, this is where we diverge
from the dogma.

300
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,333
That first variant encountered a creature

301
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:40,416
created from all the tears in reality,

302
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,791
capable of consuming time
and space itself.

303
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:44,875
A creature...

304
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,125
you both know.

305
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,916
Alioth.

306
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,500
Bingo!

307
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:57,250
I harnessed the beast's power
and began experimenting on it.

308
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:04,041
I weaponized Alioth

309
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,291
and I ended...
I ended the Multiversal War.

310
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,708
Once I isolated our timeline,

311
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,125
all I had to do
was manage the flow of time

312
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,083
and prevent any further branches.

313
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,625
Hence, the TVA.

314
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:25,583
Hence, the Time-Keepers
and a highly efficient bureaucracy.

315
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:30,958
Hence, ages...
...and ages of cosmic harmony.

316
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,416
Hence...

317
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:34,458
you're welcome.

318
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,583
You came to kill the devil, right?

319
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:47,666
Well, guess what?

320
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,250
I keep you safe.

321
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:56,916
And if you think I'm evil, well,

322
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:03,208
just wait till you meet my variants.

323
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,208
And that's the gambit.

324
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,083
Stifling order or cataclysmic chaos.

325
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,541
You may hate the dictator,
but something...

326
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,541
...far worse is gonna fill that void
if you depose of him.

327
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,916
I've lived a million lifetimes.

328
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:34,500
I've gone through every scenario.

329
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:36,625
This is the only way.

330
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,083
The TVA,

331
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:41,833
it works.

332
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:45,041
Or you're a liar.

333
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,375
Or I'm a liar.

334
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,083
So you just...

335
00:24:55,333 --> 00:25:00,125
continue to prune innocent timelines?

336
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,208
Mmm-mmm.

337
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,333
You two would.

338
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:08,791
There's two options! One...

339
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,625
you kill me and destroy all this,
so you don't just have one devil,

340
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:16,125
you have an infinite amount. Or...

341
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:18,291
you two.

342
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:20,541
You two run the thing.

343
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,333
You're lying.

344
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,791
Why would you give up being in control?

345
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:36,666
Buddy...

346
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:40,375
I'm tired.

347
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,041
And I'm older.

348
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:48,583
I'm older than I look.

349
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:56,166
This game is for the young, the hungry.

350
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:02,458
I've gone through a lot of scenarios...

351
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,708
trying to find the right person
to take this spot.

352
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:12,500
It turns out that person came in two.

353
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:19,916
But it's definitely you two.

354
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:23,958
So, no more lies.

355
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,833
You kill me and the Sacred Timeline
is completely exposed.

356
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:30,250
Multiversal War.

357
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:36,333
Or you take over and return to the TVA
as its benevolent rulers.

358
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:41,291
Tell the workforce who they are
and why they do what they do.

359
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:47,208
You treated real people's lives
like some kind of game.

360
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:52,000
It's not personal, it's practical.

361
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:54,166
It was personal to me.

362
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,458
Grow up! Grow up, Sylvie!

363
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:01,041
Murderer! Hypocrite!

364
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:05,541
We're all villains here.

365
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:10,416
We've all done horrible,
terrible, horrific things.

366
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,833
But now, we, you...

367
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:23,166
have a chance to do them
for a good reason.

368
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:50,458
We just crossed...

369
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:53,166
the threshold.

370
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:01,541
Oh.

371
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,250
So, I fibbed.

372
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:24,625
I fibbed earlier when I said
I know how everything's going to go. I...

373
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,958
I know... I knew...
...everything up to a certain point,

374
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,875
and that point was about...

375
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:36,458
seven, eight, nine, ten seconds ago.

376
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:42,958
But now I have no idea.

377
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:45,500
No idea how the rest of this
is going to go.

378
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:49,791
I'm being candid.

379
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:54,708
So, that's it?

380
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:58,416
That's it?

381
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:02,375
This is what happens at the end of time?

382
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:06,833
And now you're just gonna sit there
with all that freedom and...

383
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,583
let us decide your fate?

384
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,833
Yes!

385
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,458
Yes! Yes! What's the worst
that can happen?

386
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,333
You either...

387
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:20,041
take over and my life's work continues

388
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:25,583
or you plunge a blade in my chest
and an infinite amount of me...

389
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:30,708
start another Multiversal War.
And I just...

390
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,166
end up right back here anyways.

391
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:38,125
Reincarnation, baby.

392
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:42,166
No, it's just another lie.

393
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,875
Another manipulation.

394
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:48,291
Oh.

395
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:49,416
No lie.

396
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:52,458
No manipulation.

397
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:13,833
Wow.

398
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:21,708
I love this.

399
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:29,125
I love... all this honesty.

400
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,625
Feels like a fresh start.

401
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,708
Oh, holy...

402
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:54,601
- What're you doing?
- Hang on a moment.

403
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:56,791
Let's just talk about it.

404
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:59,250
Well, how about we finish what we started
and kill him?

405
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:06,458
- What if he's telling the truth?
- So what?

406
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:07,833
- I believe him.
- Believe what?

407
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:09,625
That a bazillion boogeymen
will turn up

408
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:11,375
just because we give people free will?

409
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:13,291
- He's a liar, Loki.
- So am I.

410
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:16,000
And I don't think he was lying.
Not about that.

411
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,583
Insane? Yes.
But maybe he was telling the truth.

412
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:21,000
Better hurry.
Timeline's already branching.

413
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:23,333
- So, what are you suggesting?
- That we think about it.

414
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:25,541
And what precisely
is there to think about?

415
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:27,750
Weren't you listening
to what he was saying?

416
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:28,833
That's the gambit.

417
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:31,708
Remove the dictator
and what fills the void?

418
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:34,625
Ah.

419
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:37,166
You want the throne?

420
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:40,083
No, that's not it. No.

421
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,416
- I don't believe you.
- Sylvie, the universe is in the balance,

422
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,250
everything we know to be true. Everything.

423
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:49,083
I know the TVA has hurt us both.

424
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:50,791
But what if by taking him out,

425
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,625
we risk unleashing something even worse?

426
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:58,708
All I'm suggesting is we just
take a minute to think about it.

427
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:03,041
I promise you from my heart
this isn't about a throne.

428
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:05,166
What was I thinking trusting you?

429
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,583
Has this whole thing been a con?

430
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:09,666
Really?

431
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:12,791
That's what you think of me...

432
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:15,708
after all this time?

433
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:17,041
Sure. Why not?

434
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,666
Evil Loki's master plan comes together.

435
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:24,750
Well, you never trusted me, did you?
What was the point?

436
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:29,958
Can't you see?
This is bigger than our experience.

437
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:32,666
Why aren't we seeing this the same way?

438
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:35,833
Because you can't trust...

439
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,833
and I can't be trusted.

440
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,875
Then I guess we're in a pickle.

441
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,500
Sylvie, wait.

442
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,166
Wait.

443
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:17,000
Sylvie. Sylvie.

444
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:19,750
Maybe he's lying! Maybe he's not.

445
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:22,708
The cost of getting this wrong
is too great.

446
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:24,333
Fine. Do it.

447
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,833
Kill me. Take your throne.

448
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:29,041
No.

449
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,875
Sylvie, stop. Stop.

450
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:55,416
Stop.

451
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,750
Stop.

452
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:10,916
I've been where you are.

453
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,166
I've felt what you feel.

454
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:23,125
Don't ask me how I know.

455
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:27,083
All I know...

456
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:31,416
is I don't wanna hurt you.

457
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:35,916
I don't want a throne.

458
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:40,333
I just...

459
00:34:47,791 --> 00:34:49,666
I just want you to be okay.

460
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:13,291
But I'm not you.

461
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,333
Incredible.

462
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,833
Aren't you gonna beg for your life?

463
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:50,000
Um, could, could.

464
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:00,500
I'll see you soon.

465
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:21,250
No turning back now.

466
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:25,041
Who said anything about turning back?

467
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,166
"For all time."

468
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:35,708
"Always."

469
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,416
Copy. Reporting to the armory, sir.

470
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:10,166
That's, what, 63 new branches
in this unit alone?

471
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,458
Does he want us
to just let them all branch?

472
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:15,125
- At this point, how are we gonna stop it?
- We can't!

473
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:16,208
What?

474
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:18,166
What'd you say?

475
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:20,291
It's done, Mobius.

476
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:22,416
We made a terrible mistake.

477
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,958
- What's done?
- What?

478
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:26,208
We freed the Timeline.

479
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:29,708
We found him beyond the storm.

480
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:32,083
A Citadel at the End of Time.

481
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:35,000
He's terrifying. He planned everything.

482
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:37,250
He's seen everything. He knows everything.

483
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,541
It's complicated. Okay?

484
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:40,166
- Right.
- But someone is coming.

485
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43,041
Countless different versions
of a very dangerous person.

486
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:45,208
And they're all set on war.
We need to prepare.

487
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:47,250
Take it easy.
You're an analyst, right?

488
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:48,958
- What division are you from?
- What?

489
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:52,125
- What are you talking about?
- Who are you? What's your name?

490
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:54,125
Boots on the ground now. Archives.

491
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:56,291
Who are you?
