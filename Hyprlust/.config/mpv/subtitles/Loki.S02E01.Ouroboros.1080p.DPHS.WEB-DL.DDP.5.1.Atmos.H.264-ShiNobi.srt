1
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:09,000
I hereby arrest you for crimes
against the Sacred Timeline.

2
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:11,333
How do you plead?

3
00:00:14,417 --> 00:00:17,708
<i>Long ago, the all-knowing
Time-Keepers emerged,</i>

4
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:21,375
<i>creating and organizing
the Sacred Timeline.</i>

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,375
<i>Sometimes, people like you
veer off the path.</i>

6
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,875
<i>We call those Variants.</i>

7
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,417
I'm Agent Mobius, by the way.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,518
- How long have you been here?
- I don't know.

9
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:33,500
<i>It's hard to say.
Time passes differently here in the TVA.</i>

10
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:34,875
<i>I can't go back, can I?</i>

11
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:40,333
I can't offer you salvation, but maybe
I can offer you something better.

12
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:43,000
<i>A fugitive Variant's
been killing our Minutemen.</i>

13
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:46,083
<i>The Variant we're hunting is you.</i>

14
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:48,583
- Trusting this man is not a good idea.
- I can handle him.

15
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:50,292
The Time-Keepers didn't create you.

16
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,083
They kidnapped you from the timeline!

17
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,667
You were disloyal to the TVA.

18
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,726
<i>You were
in the Time-Keepers' chambers.</i>

19
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,643
<i>- They weren't real.
- Why'd you think</i>

20
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:59,708
- that changes anything?
- That changes everything!

21
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,000
Lamentis, The Void.

22
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:05,625
<i>Every step you took to get here,</i>

23
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:09,417
I paved the road.

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,792
You kill me and destroy all this,
and you don't just have one devil,

25
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,417
you have an infinite amount.

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,917
Or you take over
and return to the TVA as its rulers.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,375
- What if he's telling the truth?
- He's a liar, Loki.

28
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,667
I'll see you soon.

29
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,792
<i>Someone is coming.</i>

30
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,833
<i>Countless different versions
of a very dangerous person.</i>

31
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:33,167
<i>And they're all set on war.
We need to prepare.</i>

32
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,170
<i>Take it easy.
What division are you from?</i>

33
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,625
- What? What are you talking about?
- Who are you? What's your name?

34
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:41,125
Boots on the ground now. Archives.

35
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,250
Hold it right there, Variant!

36
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,750
What is going on?

37
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,792
Mobius, it's me.

38
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:04,708
I don't know you.

39
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,625
Hey!

40
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,042
<i>Calm your mind and relax.</i>

41
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,542
I'm fine. I'm fine.

42
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,125
Morning!

43
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,375
She'll be fine.

44
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,042
<i>Level five intruder.</i>

45
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,625
<i>He's hopped into a mail cart
and descended to the lower level.</i>

46
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,417
Casey.

47
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,458
Have we met each other?

48
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:43,458
Casey, help me.
Please, tell me you know what's going on.

49
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:45,042
Don't you remember me?

50
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,500
I got him. I got the intruder.

51
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,750
I got the intruder!

52
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:09,167
Loki.

53
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:10,917
What?

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,292
Just a second ago, you didn't know me.

55
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,583
Casey. Casey.

56
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:23,208
Casey, something terrible is happening.

57
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:25,167
I'm being pulled from...

58
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,750
Wait, no.

59
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,375
Has that always been there?

60
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,500
The crack?
It's been there as long as I can remember.

61
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,750
I was in the past.

62
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:45,542
Where's Mobius? B-15?

63
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:52,708
They're probably in, uh,

64
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:56,542
Chrono Bay Three, so...

65
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:00,667
Loki?

66
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:26,000
Now what?

67
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,333
Now, the branches keep on growing

68
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:32,000
and we tell the people of the TVA
the truth about this place.

69
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,250
And you think people
are gonna be ready to hear that?

70
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,250
People have lives
on the timeline, Mobius.

71
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,458
Yes, I know.

72
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:42,708
They should have the chance
to live those lives.

73
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:43,958
Think about it.

74
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:47,333
Hey, everything you've been doing is wrong
and all your gods are dead.

75
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:49,583
How are people gonna take that?

76
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,750
We have to give it a shot.

77
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,375
Hey, Mobius,
Loki was just here looking for you.

78
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,542
Loki's here?

79
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,250
- He was, then he disappeared.
- I don't understand.

80
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,208
He disappeared right in front of me.

81
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,750
He looked like he was in pain.

82
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,875
Maybe Miss Minutes can locate him.

83
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,375
You just saw him?

84
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:10,542
I did.

85
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,208
Miss Minutes? It's not working.

86
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:13,833
Hey, I have a question.

87
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:17,833
Can I help you with something, X-5?

88
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:20,750
We don't see you down here too often.

89
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:25,000
This one here.
Is this on the Sacred Timeline?

90
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,417
'Cause looks fun.

91
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:31,833
Jet Skis, Sea-Doos.

92
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,500
Is one of these calling your name, Mobius?

93
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,542
Well, I don't know about calling,

94
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,083
maybe gently whispering.

95
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:45,417
"Mobius! Come take us for a little spin."

96
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,167
The funny thing about Jet Skis,

97
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,958
everyone thinks that
it's a personal watercraft,

98
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:52,417
and it's actually a brand,
same way Kleenex is.

99
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,083
Mobius, I don't care.

100
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:57,167
Why'd you ask?

101
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,833
With Renslayer missing,
there's a new judges' council.

102
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:02,208
So, General Dox and Judge Gamble

103
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:05,375
would like to see you both
in the War Room.

104
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,667
I wonder what that's about, huh?

105
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:28,542
Mobius. Where is he?

106
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,375
He's in the War Room.

107
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,375
We're answering
to the judges' council now?

108
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:54,125
- Okay, they probably heard the rumors...
- Mob...

109
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,250
What?

110
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,833
Nothing. Let's just ease them into it.

111
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:00,317
- We're just gonna tell them the truth.
- Agreed, but gently.

112
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,333
- What is that?
- I don't know.

113
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,083
Mobius, I was just doing my job.

114
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:15,167
You mean pruning me.

115
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:17,917
Yeah, well, I guess you were
just following orders.

116
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,625
It's actually Renslayer
who really owes me the apology.

117
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,167
What's the mood like in there?

118
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,292
<i>You're all Variants!</i>

119
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,667
<i>Everyone who works at the TVA.</i>

120
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:23,833
<i>The Time-Keepers didn't create you.
They kidnapped you from the timeline</i>

121
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:25,792
<i>and erased your memories.</i>

122
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:30,792
<i>Memories she can access
through enchantment.</i>

123
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:39,542
<i>So, before this, you had a past,
maybe you had a family, a life.</i>

124
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,417
The branches are growing.
They're way past red line.

125
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,958
And you put out an order to stop pruning.

126
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:54,792
We just need a moment to explain.

127
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,500
Into the microphone, Hunter.

128
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,625
We are doing this by the book
and on the record.

129
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,458
We just need a moment to explain.

130
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:04,208
Make it make sense.

131
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:31,917
<i>You are quite a marvel.</i>

132
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,917
<i>I will be proud to lead with you.</i>

133
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,750
<i>You made a difference in this war.</i>

134
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,583
<i>Thank you for being on my team.</i>

135
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:00,542
<i>For us.</i>

136
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,875
<i>For All Time.</i>

137
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,125
<i>Always.</i>

138
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,833
<i>Ravonna Renslayer,
you are quite a marvel.</i>

139
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:12,042
<i>I will be proud to lead with you.</i>

140
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:16,292
And under whose authority did you make
the call to stop pruning branches?

141
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,750
We didn't have time for proper protocol.

142
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:22,417
Don't you understand? We're all Variants!

143
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,958
D-90 testified

144
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:27,042
that he went to the timeline
and saw Renslayer's Variant.

145
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:31,292
And that would certainly corroborate
what B-15 is saying.

146
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,417
That's right.

147
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,458
Renslayer had a life on the timeline.

148
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:36,792
- On the record, 15.
- To hell with the record.

149
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,000
You had a life on the timeline.

150
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,333
And so did you.

151
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:44,625
So did I.

152
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,542
Look, we get the concerns
'cause we had 'em also.

153
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:51,375
But let's also admit that
the timeline is branching.

154
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,708
The sky hasn't fallen, we're...

155
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,351
What sky are you looking at?

156
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:58,042
Are you seeing this
robot head on the table?

157
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,417
The sky is falling, Mobius.
This changes everything!

158
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,792
This changes nothing.

159
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:07,458
We won't let the timeline branch.
I'm sorry, Hunter.

160
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:11,667
If we don't protect it,
what on earth are you suggesting?

161
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,750
Protect? Is that what you think
we've been doing?

162
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,750
With all due respect, ma'am,

163
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:22,500
we haven't been protecting,
we've been destroying.

164
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,000
There are people with lives
on those branches,

165
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,375
and we have committed atrocities

166
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,226
- every time we prune.
- Atrocities?

167
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,083
- Yes.
- Take caution in your tone.

168
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:35,958
Call it whatever you want, but we have to
take a moment to understand what is...

169
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:38,625
- We don't have a moment.
- You've made your position clear.

170
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,375
So we don't have time for protocol now?

171
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,708
And you've made
your position clear, Hunter.

172
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:58,792
All my life, I've always handed down
the same verdict.

173
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,167
Guilty.

174
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,042
The Time-Keepers deemed it so.

175
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:07,375
Ma'am, I know how hard it is

176
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,250
to turn your back on everything
you've believed in.

177
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,917
But the TVA has to change,
and it has to start now.

178
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:19,333
We can't go back
to pruning those branches.

179
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,208
I can do anything.

180
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:33,458
Anything.

181
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:39,542
Tell the TVA to stop pruning,
effective immediately.

182
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,208
Loki?

183
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:46,351
- Mobius. You know me.
- Where the hell were you?

184
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,667
- Hey.
- Help me.

185
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,184
- Hey!
- What just happened?

186
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,559
- A moment ago, you didn't know me.
- Stand down!

187
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,125
- Tell me you recognize me. Do you know me?
- Yeah.

188
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,792
Everyone, stand down!

189
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:59,000
- Come on. Come here.
- Mobius. We found him.

190
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,875
- Who?
- Him.

191
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,208
Loki?

192
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,458
Get back!

193
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,083
That's who built this place!
That's who stole your lives!

194
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,625
That's who's coming back!

195
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,708
Okay.

196
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,125
Easy, put it down.

197
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,292
- Put it down.
- She was going to kill him.

198
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,815
- Who, Sylvie?
- Mobius, yes.

199
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:42,917
Sylvie? Where is she?

200
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,500
- I don't know.
- It's okay. It's all right.

201
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,543
- Come.
- She kicked me through a Time Door.

202
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:02,083
The Time-Keepers are fake,
but their warnings were real.

203
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:05,125
Seems pretty straightforward to me.

204
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,625
What do you want me to do?

205
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,708
We need to know what happened
at the End of Time.

206
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:11,917
Find Sylvie.

207
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,750
She's the reason we're in this mess.

208
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,792
Who's she? What does she want with Sylvie?

209
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,833
General Dox. Don't worry. Are you okay?

210
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,333
- What happened with the cloud monster?
- Alioth?

211
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:28,708
Alioth was a distraction.

212
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:30,458
He was a guard dog. We found him.

213
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:32,125
A Citadel at the End of Time.

214
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,917
- But where's Sylvie?
- I don't know, she's still there.

215
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,417
I just wanted time to think.

216
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,958
It was an impossible choice,
but she seemed so certain.

217
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:40,750
How could she be given the consequences?

218
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,458
- I just wanted time to think.
- Okay, slow down, Loki.

219
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:45,833
You wanted time to think, so, let's think.

220
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:49,292
It's okay.

221
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,500
Mobius,

222
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:55,167
we got to the man at the End of Time,

223
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,875
and he made sense.

224
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,208
We thought it was about
freeing the timeline,

225
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:04,917
but that brings only more malevolence,
more violence, more war.

226
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,458
More of him. They're coming.

227
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:07,875
- They're all coming.
- Who?

228
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,292
- "You came to kill the devil."
- I don't understand.

229
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:12,583
Maybe he was.

230
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:17,167
But maybe he wasn't.
She was convinced he was.

231
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,458
We fought, Mobius,
and she kicked me through a Time Door.

232
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,167
Well, I'd ask who won, but...

233
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:28,833
It was a draw.

234
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:33,083
You both kicked each other
through Time Doors simultaneously?

235
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:35,750
No. I was actively trying not to fight her.

236
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,833
I was trying to stop her.
She was gonna kill him.

237
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:39,250
Stop. Relax. Forget about it.

238
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,917
Look, Renslayer kicked me down
some steps, too. Listen, just calm down.

239
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,500
I just wish I had tried harder,
I wish I'd had more time.

240
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,042
Don't do the could a would a shoulda.
Focus on what we know.

241
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,083
That.

242
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,667
That is what we know.
War. And it's on its way.

243
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,625
Maybe it's true, everything he was doing,
the pruning,

244
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,375
the preservation of the Sacred Timeline.

245
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,125
It was about preventing more of him.

246
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,917
There was no simple choice, no other way.

247
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,375
- That's who you showed us in there?
- He Who Remains.

248
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,042
This is his kingdom.

249
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,958
And he said he keeps us safe,
but how can you believe that?

250
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:13,375
- He built this place.
- No, how would I not remember that?

251
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,583
- How could he...
- Because he wiped your memories.

252
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,958
And he obviously did it more than once.

253
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,625
- They have to listen to us.
- Hey!

254
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:25,125
Believe me, they listened to you, okay?
We heard you loud and clear.

255
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,542
You have to explain to me exactly,

256
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:31,417
how did you just appear in there?

257
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,417
Did you come straight
from the End of Time?

258
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:36,083
No, I was in the past.

259
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,083
What do you mean, in the past? Where?

260
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:41,625
- Here, the past TVA.
- No, there is no past TVA.

261
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,792
- Time doesn't work like that here.
- It does, it's happening to me.

262
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,083
- It's impossible. No, it's not.
- It's possible.

263
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,875
- Did you see it?
- Yeah, I saw it.

264
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,125
Yeah? What does it... How does it look?

265
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,167
It looks... I mean, how does it feel?

266
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:04,000
It's not that bad.

267
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,417
Really? I mean, it look...

268
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:10,583
I guess it doesn't look that bad,

269
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:12,333
but we definitely gotta get you help.

270
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,958
Let me call Miss Minutes.

271
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:16,000
- No. You can't trust her.
- What?

272
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,125
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.

273
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,542
She was there with him at the End of Time.

274
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,458
No, we gotta get you checked out.

275
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:28,458
Yeah, let's swing you by
Repairs & Advancement. Come on.

276
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,102
- They'll have a look at you.
- Where's that? I need to get back.

277
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:32,292
Come on.

278
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,542
We need to deal with
the bigger problem here.

279
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,250
- He Who Remains.
- I understand and we'll get to that.

280
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,875
In order to do that,
I need a Loki Who Remains.

281
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,833
We need to address you disappearing.

282
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:45,208
What? I don't keep disappearing.
We don't have time...

283
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:46,417
Loki...

284
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,250
You just disappeared.

285
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,917
I can't keep looking at it
'cause it's horrible.

286
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,417
What? I thought you said
it didn't look that bad.

287
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,583
I was lying.

288
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:59,000
It's terrible,
looks like you're being born or dying

289
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,292
or both at the same time.

290
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,125
- It's freaking me out.
- It's okay.

291
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,417
It looks really painful.

292
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,708
- It's not that bad. I can handle it.
- Come on. How does it look?

293
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,583
Okay, and Sylvie kicking you through
the Time Door into the past,

294
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:16,208
that somehow started all this?

295
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:19,375
All I know is I was in the past.

296
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,792
It was He Who Remains' TemPad,
so maybe that's how it was possible.

297
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,125
Wait, that's who you said
had my memory wiped?

298
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,250
Yes. He Who Remains.

299
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,583
Is that what you're calling him,
or that's his name?

300
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:29,833
That's how he's introduced.

301
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:32,625
That's arrogant. It's like
calling yourself "Last Man Standing."

302
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,393
Is it arrogant if you can back it up?

303
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:36,042
- Can he back it up?
- Yeah.

304
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,250
That's scary.

305
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,042
- Imagine a million of them.
- I'd rather not.

306
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,417
Where are you taking me?

307
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,833
It's all right,
it's a little off the beaten path.

308
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,917
I have no memory
of having my memory wiped.

309
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:51,875
- You know where you're going?
- Yeah, it's just right up here.

310
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,167
It's been a while
since I've been down here.

311
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:04,458
Actually, I'm not sure
I've ever been down here.

312
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:11,500
Oh, hey, welcome to R & A.

313
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,792
Good. We're in the right place.

314
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:17,042
We have a little bit of a situation
we wanted to run by you.

315
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,875
Mobius!

316
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:20,708
Wow.

317
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:22,042
Great to see you again.

318
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,542
Good to see you, too. Yeah, I...

319
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,958
Loki, I wanna introduce you to...

320
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:32,583
I'm Ouroboros.

321
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,750
- Nice to meet you, Loki.
- Sorry.

322
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:35,833
Ouroboros.

323
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:37,677
- Ouroboros, hi.
- But he calls me O.B.

324
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,625
Yeah, I call him O.B.

325
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,500
That's a nickname I have. Yeah.

326
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:42,833
Wow.

327
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,167
How long has it been?

328
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,833
How long has it been? Uh...

329
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,375
Could it be three or four...

330
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,167
- Four hundred years.
- What?

331
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,833
- Feels like a thousand, right?
- Yeah.

332
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:59,625
Remember, you got off on the wrong floor
and I told you it was the wrong floor...

333
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,333
Wait, that's right! Yes!

334
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:03,458
I stayed for a little bit.
He took me over...

335
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,333
- You stayed...
- No, you left immediately.

336
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,333
Well, I'm back.

337
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:12,208
Yes, you are.

338
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:14,500
Believe it or not, he was my last visitor.

339
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,000
Wow.

340
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:19,333
- Reunited. Four hundred years.
- Yeah.

341
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:21,684
- That's right.
- Yeah.

342
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,375
- Hey, how are the other guys doin'?
- What other guys?

343
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:26,750
- What other guys?
- It's just O.B.

344
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:29,125
- It's just O.B.
- Yeah. O.B.

345
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,708
- Oh. Hang on.
- Hold on, O.B. Okay.

346
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:38,000
The work orders really pile up
if I take a break, so I just keep at it.

347
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,958
Forever. No sleep.

348
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,625
O.B., we just have
a quick question for you.

349
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:53,417
Great being part of a team.

350
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,250
So, how is the team doing up there?

351
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,292
Pretty great. Yeah. I mean, well...

352
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:04,000
You know about the Time-Keepers
and, you know...

353
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:07,833
That! That's what's been happening.

354
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:09,625
Wow. Time slipping.

355
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:12,292
- What, you... Time... You know that?
- Yeah.

356
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,708
- You've seen that?
- Yeah.

357
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,208
- Can you fix that?
- No.

358
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,958
It's impossible to time slip in the TVA.

359
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:19,917
I know, but we just saw it happen.

360
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:24,583
Yeah. I'm having trouble reconciling that.

361
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,667
Ouroboros.

362
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:34,333
Uh, may I call you "O.B."?

363
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:35,542
"O.B."?

364
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,125
I like that.

365
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,708
- Uh, do I know you?
- Yes.

366
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:42,875
In the future. Well, it's your future.

367
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,833
My present. It's complicated.

368
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:46,292
I've been pulled through

369
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,417
- different times in the TVA...
- Time slipping.

370
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,917
That!

371
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I've been time slipping in the TVA...

372
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,792
It's impossible to time slip in the TVA.

373
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,333
- But you saw it happen.
- Yeah.

374
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:57,417
I'm having trouble reconciling that.

375
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,125
Looked like your friend was time slipping,
but it must be something else.

376
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,833
I've never seen anything
close to that happen before.

377
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:07,167
Wait.

378
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,208
No.

379
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:11,000
There was one time.

380
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,833
That guy that was here? What was his name?

381
00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:14,167
- Loki?
- Yeah.

382
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,958
A long time ago, he came to me
complaining about time slipping.

383
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:20,750
- How did I not remember that?
- Wait, is he talking to you in the past

384
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,250
and you're just remembering it?

385
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:25,000
Wow. That makes perfect sense.

386
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:27,292
- There's no flaw in that logic.
- Yes.

387
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:30,250
- Time slipping is possible at the TVA.
- Yes. You remember.

388
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,958
- What did you tell him?
- I told him...

389
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:33,042
That's impossible.

390
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:36,708
That's not impossible because
I was just with you in the future.

391
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:38,708
Mmm... I think I would remember that.

392
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:40,958
Yes, but it hasn't happened to you yet.

393
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:42,583
- Do you see?
- Good point.

394
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:46,167
It would be convenient if we were
having this conversation in the future

395
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,417
and this were the past.

396
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,542
We were. This is the... Never mind.

397
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,375
O.B., look, for the sake of argument,

398
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:57,875
let's just say, if it were possible
to time slip in the TVA,

399
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,292
- how might one...
- It's not.

400
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,167
I understand that.

401
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:05,500
But theoretically, if it were possible
to time slip in the TVA,

402
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:07,417
how might one remedy that?

403
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,500
First off, someone in the time
you want to end up in

404
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:13,125
would need a Temporal Aura Extractor.

405
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:16,083
- Do you have one of those?
- I do not.

406
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:20,417
Ha! I got it.

407
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,417
One Temporal Aura Extractor.

408
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,583
Great.

409
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:28,375
Can you hold onto that
until my friend Mobius drops by?

410
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:30,917
No. Wait.

411
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:32,875
Yes?

412
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:36,125
I actually do have an Extractor here.

413
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:40,917
One Temporal Aura Extractor.

414
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,333
And did you happen to discuss
how to use such a thing with my friend?

415
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,292
You need to get to the Temporal Loom,

416
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:49,583
so the Extractor can pull Loki
directly out of the time stream.

417
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,875
Wait, so,
I need to get to the Temporal Loom

418
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:55,417
so the Extractor can pull Loki
out of the time stream?

419
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,667
- But it could be dangerous.
- How dangerous?

420
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,292
Not too bad if you're quick about it.

421
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:01,667
- Gotta be quick about it.
- If you spend too long in it,

422
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,333
that kinda temporal energy
will peel the skin right off you.

423
00:26:05,417 --> 00:26:06,833
Wait, you said "not too bad"

424
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:09,333
and you're talking about me
getting my skin peeled off.

425
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:11,917
Not too bad compared
to what Loki has to do.

426
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,125
Why, what's Loki gotta do?

427
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:17,042
Violently rip myself from
every thread of time and space?

428
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,500
- All at once?
- That means prune yourself.

429
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,542
- Why?
- When something is pruned,

430
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,167
it's released from time,

431
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,375
so the hope is that
after you prune yourself,

432
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:28,458
the Extractor will pull you
into the present.

433
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:31,875
Of course.

434
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:33,917
Yeah.

435
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:37,083
Um... and then if it doesn't do that?

436
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:40,750
You heard about how if you fall
into a black hole you turn into spaghetti?

437
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,500
- No.
- Good.

438
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,500
The less you know about that, the better.

439
00:26:49,917 --> 00:26:51,167
Damn it!

440
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,792
Hey, Loki's back.

441
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:54,917
I guess you two are ready to go.

442
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,833
Wait, am I ready
to get my skin peeled off? I don't know.

443
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:00,458
Am I ready to rip myself
from every thread of time?

444
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:02,083
I'd rather have that.

445
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:04,375
You'd rather be disassembled
and never reassembled?

446
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:05,792
Than have your skin ripped off?

447
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:07,625
At least you get to live.

448
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:10,125
Live? What's the quality of life
with no skin?

449
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,583
There has to be another way.

450
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:19,542
- Huh. Been doing that all day.
- No, it's not the lamp.

451
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:21,750
We're having power surges
all through the TVA.

452
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:26,708
What did you say?

453
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:42,125
So, the timeline is branching now?

454
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,792
I bet that's what's causing
the power surges.

455
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:47,458
- And maybe your time slipping.
- Really? How?

456
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:49,958
Things are a mess upstairs.
This better be important.

457
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:51,250
It is.

458
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,667
The branching is overloading
the Temporal Loom.

459
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:55,250
- Temporal Loom?
- That's bad.

460
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,750
You know, the Temporal Loom.

461
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:59,750
- It's in the <i>TVA Guidebook.</i>
- The what?

462
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,875
There's one on every desk at the TVA.

463
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:06,583
It's a detailed index of
every mechanical classification

464
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:08,625
and maintenance routine in each sector,

465
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:12,000
on each device, and inside
every computer program at the TVA.

466
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:16,708
I wrote it myself.

467
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:19,958
Okay, O.B.,
this piece just came off right here.

468
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:21,542
Is that important? I think...

469
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,875
The Temporal Loom is the heart of the TVA.

470
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:16,625
It's where raw time is refined
into physical timeline.

471
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:27,250
And it's not constructed to weave together
so many new branches,

472
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,583
so it's overloading.

473
00:29:31,417 --> 00:29:33,125
I've never seen it like this.

474
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:35,625
It looks like a disaster.

475
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:37,833
It is a disaster.

476
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:47,042
You don't get down here too much, I guess.

477
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,333
I never had to.

478
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:50,292
Miss Minutes took care of everything.

479
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:52,750
I just ran diagnostics
every few hundred years.

480
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,750
So, O.B., what do we do?
How do we stop it? The meltdown?

481
00:29:56,542 --> 00:29:58,333
We need to prune those extra branches.

482
00:29:58,417 --> 00:30:02,292
That means the death of countless people.
We can't do that.

483
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:06,250
Then I'll need to close the blast doors
to protect the TVA,

484
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:08,958
while I figure out how to retrofit it
to handle those branches.

485
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:11,750
- What about the time slipping?
- Once those doors close,

486
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:15,333
we won't be able to re-sync you,
so, it's now or never.

487
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:16,458
What?

488
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:22,375
Okay.

489
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:23,500
- Now!
- Wait!

490
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:26,000
It's now, but now isn't for a little bit.

491
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:27,958
We still gotta get Mobius into position.

492
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:29,292
But first...

493
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:33,042
Mobius, to fix Loki's time slipping,

494
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:36,292
you'll go out there
and launch the Extractor,

495
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:41,000
which will pull Loki from the time stream
before I need to close the blast doors.

496
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:43,958
Loki, this timer is synced to the Loom.

497
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:49,875
You'll stand by to prune yourself
within moments after this turns green.

498
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:54,000
Green means Mobius succeeded.

499
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:56,583
Green means prune.

500
00:30:56,708 --> 00:31:01,167
If you're too late,
you will be lost to time forever

501
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,958
and Mobius will lose all of his skin.

502
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,208
Okay, you've got about an hour.

503
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:11,417
You've got about five minutes.

504
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,750
Anyway, I'm gonna get everything ready.

505
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:14,875
Okay.

506
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,583
Dox and her crew are raiding the armory.

507
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:21,167
They're going after Sylvie.
That's their only lead.

508
00:31:21,292 --> 00:31:24,417
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing? Where are you going?

509
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,542
- Sylvie, Dox...
- No!

510
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:27,167
We have one shot at this.

511
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,750
I'll handle Dox.

512
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:31,167
Good luck.

513
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,542
Mobius, if I...

514
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,458
- If I don't make it back, I...
- You'll make it back.

515
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:43,875
Right, but when I use this thing,
I might not make it back...

516
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:59,458
He'll make it back.

517
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:31,875
It's the future.

518
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,750
The Timestick.

519
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,375
Once these doors open,

520
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:46,042
the temporal radiation
will start aging away your suit,

521
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:47,333
so get down the gangway,

522
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:49,583
lock the Temporal Aura Extractor
into place,

523
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,750
and hoof it back here
the moment I tell you to.

524
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:54,125
- How am I gonna hoof it in this?
- You got to.

525
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:56,708
Or what?

526
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:58,958
Or the blast doors will close
and lock you out.

527
00:32:59,042 --> 00:33:01,667
And then, your suit will age away,
you will age away,

528
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:05,458
and you'll get very old, and all your skin
will get peeled away, and you will die.

529
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,167
Is this cracked?

530
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:16,833
- You're good.
<i>- O.B.!</i>

531
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:20,000
<i>Get ready to see some hoofin'
like you've never seen before.</i>

532
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,083
Okay.

533
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:20,000
<i>All personnel, report to your
nearest Time Door evacuation point.</i>

534
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:21,917
The Timestick.

535
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:25,250
<i>TVA code 1127.</i>

536
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:29,417
<i>All personnel, report to your nearest
Time Door evacuation point.</i>

537
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:49,458
<i>All personnel, report to your nearest
Time Door evacuation point.</i>

538
00:34:49,542 --> 00:34:51,250
Come on. The Timestick.

539
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,333
<i>TVA code 1127.</i>

540
00:34:56,417 --> 00:34:57,708
There's still time.

541
00:34:57,792 --> 00:35:01,875
<i>All personnel, report to your nearest
Time Door evacuation point.</i>

542
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,000
<i>Damn it!</i>

543
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,500
<i>Go.</i>

544
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,792
No.

545
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:49,375
Mobius, I need to
close the blast doors now

546
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:51,750
<i>to have any hope of fixing the Loom.</i>

547
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,333
<i>Give him more time.
He can still make it.</i>

548
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,500
Mobius, we have 30 seconds.

549
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:28,500
<i>Five.</i>

550
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,542
Four.

551
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,292
Three.

552
00:36:35,042 --> 00:36:36,167
Three.

553
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:38,750
<i>Three.</i>

554
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:40,792
<i>No. Not yet.</i>

555
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:41,958
<i>Not yet!</i>

556
00:36:42,042 --> 00:36:43,667
<i>Give him more time!</i>

557
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,042
Sorry.

558
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,792
<i>No. No.</i>

559
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:05,250
<i>Mobius, listen to me.</i>

560
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:08,792
There is nothing you can do for him.

561
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:11,708
<i>He's lost to time.</i>

562
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,792
He's not going to make it.

563
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:45,542
There you are!

564
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:27,875
We need to find Sylvie.

565
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,042
Where are they going?

566
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:51,125
All this for Sylvie?

567
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,125
I don't buy it.

568
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:05,167
How do I do this?

569
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:06,583
What would you like?

570
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:08,500
Not squirrel, not possum, not rats.

571
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:11,458
Something that's already dead,
and nothing with a face.

572
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:12,625
Please.

573
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:16,167
You can try our new Chicken McNuggets,

574
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:19,375
and we have a Big Mac, Filet-O-Fish,

575
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:22,708
and a hamburger, cheeseburger.

576
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:26,750
I quite like the Quarter Pounder,
which you can try with or without cheese.

577
00:42:33,708 --> 00:42:35,250
I wanna try everything.

578
00:42:37,917 --> 00:42:38,917
Okay.
