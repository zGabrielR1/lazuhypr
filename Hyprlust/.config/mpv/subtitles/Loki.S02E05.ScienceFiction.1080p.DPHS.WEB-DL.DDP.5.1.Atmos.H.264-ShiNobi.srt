1
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:06,333
No, we broke out
of your little game.

2
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:10,667
Wrong. Every step you took to get here,

3
00:00:10,917 --> 00:00:14,000
I paved the road.

4
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:19,250
People have lives
on the timeline.

5
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,708
They should have the chance
to live those lives.

6
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:24,125
Jet Skis, Sea-Doos.

7
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:27,958
- One of these calling your name, Mobius?
- I don't know about calling,

8
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:29,417
maybe gently whispering.

9
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:35,458
- That! That's what's been happening.
- Wow. Time slipping.

10
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:37,917
The branching is overloading
the Temporal Loom.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Temporal Loom?

12
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,708
The Temporal Loom
is the heart of the TVA.

13
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,792
<i>And it's not constructed to weave together
so many new branches.</i>

14
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:48,042
We need to make the rings bigger.

15
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:52,458
One of us will have to take our
Throughput Multiplier down the gangway.

16
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:54,458
And launch it towards the Loom.

17
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:57,042
I mean, Loki's really gonna
have to hoof it then, right?

18
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,125
Wait. It should be me.

19
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:06,375
The Temporal Radiation is just too high.

20
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,125
What did we do wrong?

21
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:11,292
<i>TVA code 1229.</i>

22
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,458
<i>Fail Safe Mode initiated.</i>

23
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:15,792
<i>Thank you for your service.</i>

24
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,042
No, no, no.

25
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,875
This is not happening again!

26
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,542
<i>TVA code 1229.</i>

27
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,000
<i>Thank you for your service.</i>

28
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:42,083
Hello?

29
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:52,667
<i>TVA code 1229.</i>

30
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,917
<i>Fail Safe Mode initiated.</i>

31
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,958
<i>Thank you for your service.</i>

32
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:30,958
Hello?

33
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,750
Hello?

34
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,934
- Is this everything?
- This is everything.

35
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,292
Shh!

36
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,792
Come on.

37
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,333
Come on.

38
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,208
Come on, bro. Come on.

39
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:11,708
Let's go! Hurry up!

40
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:14,208
If they catch us,
they're gonna gut us like fish.

41
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:16,625
Casey? Okay.

42
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:19,458
Casey.

43
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:21,000
Thank God you're here.

44
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,250
Is everyone here?

45
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,375
Who are you?

46
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,417
Not again.

47
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,875
Who am I? Casey, it's me.

48
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,292
Tell me you know who I am.

49
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,292
With the boat? You're in the wrong place.

50
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,917
- You're not supposed to be here.
- Is that the boat guy?

51
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,458
- Do you have a boat?
- A boat?

52
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:37,333
I don't know anything about a boat.

53
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:39,500
- How'd you get here?
- How did I get where?

54
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,208
- Alcatraz.
- What?

55
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,083
I don't know how I got here.

56
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,917
That's the problem.
I don't know what's happening, Casey.

57
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:50,750
Frank, why is this guy calling you Casey?

58
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,125
- I've been calling you Frank.
- Frank?

59
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,167
- You said your name was Frank.
- It is.

60
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,708
- His name's Casey.
- I don't know this guy.

61
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,042
Come on.

62
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,250
You gotta find your own way off this rock.

63
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,333
Sorry, pal.

64
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,250
Come on.

65
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:44,875
Okay, so we got a good cast
on here for you.

66
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,208
It's gonna help you heal,
but you'll have to wear it for six weeks.

67
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,333
Does it still hurt?

68
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:54,167
That's good, but do you remember
how bad it hurt when you came in?

69
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,292
That's good too.

70
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,958
But you might forget how bad it hurt
over the next six weeks,

71
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:04,458
so I'm gonna write a little reminder
on here for you.

72
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,500
Climb... Trees.

73
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,542
That's not gonna stop you, is it?

74
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:17,833
I tried.

75
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:19,083
All right, be good.

76
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:45,375
<i>Wind in the hair,
little mist slapping you in the face.</i>

77
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,542
<i>And nothing but open water
in front of you.</i>

78
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,125
Don? Don?
Your son's calling on line three.

79
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,708
Tell him I'll call him back.

80
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:56,500
So talk to me. What are you thinking?

81
00:09:56,583 --> 00:10:00,125
Sorry. I, uh...
was more interested in a dirt bike.

82
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:06,042
Well, they say the personal watercraft
is kind of the thinking man's dirt bike.

83
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,625
Come on,
you ready for your Poseidon moment?

84
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,292
Jump up on this bad boy.

85
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,083
I'm good. Sorry.

86
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:13,833
It's okay.

87
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:17,333
Call me if you change your mind
or if you want another donut.

88
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,542
Great donuts today, Dale.

89
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,750
Pay me to put on a helmet

90
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,792
- and ride around in the mud.
- Thank God.

91
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:34,333
Hello.

92
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:39,833
- How could he not get up here, Dale?
- Crazy. I don't get it.

93
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,208
- You're here?
- Oh, yes.

94
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:46,083
Every day of the week except Sunday,
9:00 to 5:00.

95
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,750
The TVA is gone.

96
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:55,333
I think you mean ATV, and no,
you're in luck.

97
00:10:55,417 --> 00:10:57,542
We got in two of 'em last week.
They're upstairs.

98
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,726
You don't remember me either?

99
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,125
No, no, I do. You were...
You were in just the other day, right?

100
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,875
Your son's on line three.

101
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,500
I'm sorry, single dad, give me a second.

102
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,000
- Told you I'll call him back.
- Your other son.

103
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,375
Tell him I'll call him back too.

104
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,792
<i>The Zartan Contingent.</i>

105
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,083
I don't think
I've ever seen this one before.

106
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:33,542
It's really good.
He's one of the greats.

107
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,750
I read everything he does.

108
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,375
Hmm. I'll have to check it out.

109
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,833
I'd hurry. There's only
a few left on the shelf.

110
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,250
Hmm.

111
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,417
It's not reading the barcode.

112
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,917
I can give you cash.
I don't need a receipt or anything.

113
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah, but I have to ring it up or...

114
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,875
Are you buying your own book?

115
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,625
You...

116
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:56,958
I told you to stop putting
your sci-fi books on our shelves.

117
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:01,000
Science fiction is a well-respected
and thought-provoking genre.

118
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,125
Nobody buys it here.

119
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,875
What I'm about to tell you...

120
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,792
is going to be hard to believe.

121
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,167
Of course I believe you.
It's a dream come true.

122
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,208
One of my characters has come to life
and needs my help.

123
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:12,917
This reminds me of
what happens in <i>The Sons of Yoren.</i>

124
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,375
- What's that?
- Just, you know,

125
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,125
my most popular book of all time.

126
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,667
I'm sure I can find you a copy
somewhere around here.

127
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:22,083
Wait.

128
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:24,417
You're a writer?

129
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,875
- Yes. Science fiction.
- I'm doomed.

130
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,583
But, and this is kind of embarrassing,

131
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:35,542
I have to get a PhD to keep my day job
teaching theoretical physics at Caltech.

132
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,708
Wait, you're a scientist as well.
That's great.

133
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:40,250
Yeah, until I can quit
and write full time.

134
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:43,667
You have no idea how hard it is
to break... Hey, look at this.

135
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,750
There's a copy. You're one lucky man.

136
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,708
I'm so sorry. Can we just stay on track?

137
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:53,167
Of course. So, uh, what exactly
are you trying to do?

138
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,333
I need to go back to before
the Temporal Loom melted down.

139
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:59,375
You can't. It's impossible.

140
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,417
But don't let that stop you.

141
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,542
I don't understand what you've just said.

142
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,042
Well, you time-traveled

143
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,500
- in a place that has no time, right?
- Right.

144
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:13,333
- That's not possible.
- I know.

145
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:16,292
So you're traveling to a place
that doesn't exist anymore.

146
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:20,042
It's equally impossible, and therefore
it's something you might be able to do.

147
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,500
Sure, excellent.

148
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,542
Yeah. Makes total sense.

149
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,542
- Doesn't sound like science.
- No, but it does sound like fiction.

150
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,333
You need to learn
how to control your time slipping.

151
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,000
I can't control it. I can't just...

152
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:40,875
make it happen. It's, it's random.

153
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:44,625
But it isn't random
because you keep ending up

154
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,500
around exactly the people
you're looking for,

155
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,000
and it's evolving

156
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,125
because you're not just slipping in time,

157
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,083
you're also moving around in space.

158
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:58,333
It's like you're a better version
of one of those TemPads.

159
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,250
You make it sound like it's a good thing.

160
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,958
With science, it's all what and how.

161
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:08,625
But with fiction, it's why.

162
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:11,792
So, why do you need to do this?

163
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:15,042
Why do I need to do this?

164
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,583
I'll tell you why.

165
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,625
Because if I can't save the TVA
from being destroyed,

166
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,542
there will be nothing

167
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,542
to protect against what's coming.

168
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,542
Well, if that's the real why
that's guiding you,

169
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,208
you should be able to control it.
So, go ahead.

170
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:39,958
- Now?
- Yeah, yeah, just do it.

171
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:43,625
All right.

172
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,583
- Here we go.
- Cool.

173
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,750
Focus in on that why.

174
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,083
- You need to save the TVA.
- All right.

175
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,667
You need to save the TVA.

176
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
Anything?

177
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:15,250
I'm trying.

178
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,542
Maybe you need to try harder.

179
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:21,833
I'm trying as hard as I can.

180
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,000
You must be doing something wrong

181
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,792
because it really feels like
the time slipping is the answer.

182
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,708
- Maybe we focus on the science.
- Okay.

183
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:41,875
So this equation proposes that... Argh!

184
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,958
- What are you doing?
- Science.

185
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:48,625
Now we know that electrical pulses
don't initiate time slipping.

186
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,875
For God's sake.

187
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,417
Ah. Not fight or flight induced...

188
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,625
Okay, let's forget about
the time slipping, all right?

189
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,750
How does science help us

190
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,583
get to a place that doesn't exist?

191
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:10,042
- Well, maybe it does exist.
- It doesn't.

192
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,958
I saw it disappear with my own eyes.

193
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:16,250
But then you said you also time-traveled
in a place at the TVA, right?

194
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,500
The Time Theater, yes.

195
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:21,292
If that's the case, then maybe the place
and time you're looking for still exists,

196
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,958
but you don't know where to look.

197
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,375
Let's try this.

198
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,833
- Hold this.
- Yeah?

199
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,208
We get the band back together.

200
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:38,625
That doesn't seem very scientific.

201
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:43,083
You said everyone,
every one of your friends

202
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,333
- has a temporal aura, right?
- Right.

203
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:50,292
Well, that means a group of people

204
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:54,833
would have a collective aura
unique to that moment in time.

205
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,417
If we can get everyone together
in one place,

206
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,917
we can read that aura.

207
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,417
It will be like coordinates.

208
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:05,000
We can use these coordinates
to get back to that moment.

209
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,375
- No.
- Why?

210
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,042
We don't have one of those TemPads
you talked about.

211
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,292
Well, can you build one?
You can build one.

212
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,458
Maybe, but without any of the knowledge
of how it works,

213
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,083
I would have to invent it from scratch.

214
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:21,292
It could take a whole lifetime.

215
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:38,500
What if you had that knowledge?

216
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,792
- What's that?
- You tell me, you wrote it.

217
00:18:42,542 --> 00:18:44,583
- I did?
- You did.

218
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:46,625
There's one on every desk at the TVA.

219
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,333
So I am going to write a bestseller.

220
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:55,458
Yeah, sort of. Let's, um,
let's get to work...

221
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,208
Oh, that's a problem.

222
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,792
Okay, guys,
we're gonna have a new rule,

223
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:20,250
and that is any toy
found outside your room

224
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,542
is gonna be classified
as garbage, all right?

225
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:24,792
Trash, okay?

226
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,667
'Cause I'm tired of coming home,

227
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:32,083
having it look like some lunatic
garage sale that... Is he burnt?

228
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,583
Yeah, he's burnt.

229
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,625
How did he get burnt?

230
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:41,500
Kevin, who gave you the matches?

231
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,542
- I stole 'em.
- No, you...

232
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,083
Give 'em to me. Come on. Hand 'em over.

233
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:49,167
Don't run. Kevin. Kevin.
Kev... Kevin! Get...

234
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:53,250
Sean, go get him! Come on, hurry!

235
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,292
If you keep him from burning down
the house, I'll get you a puppy.

236
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,792
- Come on.
- And a snake!

237
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,625
That... We'll negotiate later. Run! Hurry!

238
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:05,208
Small victories.

239
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:06,375
Hello.

240
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,542
- Hello.
- Hi.

241
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,708
Hey. Oh, you were at the shop earlier.

242
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:15,708
- That's right.
- Yeah. You live around here,

243
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:17,542
or did you follow me home?

244
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:23,083
Oh, no. No, no. I was,
I was actually on my way to the...

245
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,292
and I happened to see you so I just...

246
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,208
I just thought I'd just come and say

247
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:30,500
that I'm sorry I couldn't stick around
back there.

248
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,208
I was, I was in a bit of a time crunch.

249
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:35,875
Yeah. You were looking for ATVs.

250
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,917
- The TVA.
- Yeah.

251
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,417
You know, are you still in the market?

252
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,750
'Cause I have something...

253
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,792
I got something I wanna show you.
Come here.

254
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:54,583
Now, ordinarily, I wouldn't dream of
parting with one of these beauties.

255
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:58,625
But wife is long gone
and I can't ride two of 'em.

256
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,417
Plus, the boys are probably gonna need
braces and math tutors

257
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,667
and God knows what else.

258
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,250
A beautiful union of form and function.

259
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,417
Oh, that's lovely, yeah.

260
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,292
Yeah, they really are
and it breaks my heart,

261
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,250
but what are you going to do?

262
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,167
Hey, you want a drink?
Can I get you a beer?

263
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,958
No, no, no, no. I'm fine. Thank you.

264
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:23,583
I'm afraid I'm not here to buy a jet ski.

265
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:26,583
- Oh, what are you here for?
- Listen.

266
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,167
I'm going to tell you something
that's hard to understand, Mobius.

267
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,083
- Mobius?
- Mobius, that's your name.

268
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,292
Okay, I...

269
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:40,083
- I think you have me mixed up.
- No, you see, the thing is, I don't.

270
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:44,917
Mobius is your real name
and you belong in a place called the TVA.

271
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,458
Is that right? Huh.

272
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:49,917
Okay, hold that thought.
I'm gonna go check on...

273
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,375
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I don't want any trouble.

274
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,917
- It's all right. I'm a friend.
- I know you are. I'm a friend too.

275
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:02,458
What? How did you build a TemPad so fast?

276
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:06,833
I don't know if I'd say 18 months is fast.
Well, 19 months.

277
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:10,833
I had to take a break and move out
when I lost my job and my wife left me.

278
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,417
- So what now?
- What's happening?

279
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,250
I promise you this will make sense.

280
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,583
Like... How did you...

281
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:31,583
Reality isn't what you think it is.

282
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,000
And this isn't the life of the man I know.

283
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:39,833
I don't know who you know.
I don't understand.

284
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:42,917
- I know you from a place called...
- No, you don't.

285
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,208
The Time Variance Authority.

286
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:48,417
You saved my life when I first arrived.

287
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,625
You saw something in me
that I hadn't seen in myself.

288
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,583
Are you really my friend?

289
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,125
I am.

290
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:00,250
Who's he?

291
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:04,417
- Is he my friend?
- He will be.

292
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:09,292
- Why don't I remember that?
- It's too complicated to explain it to you

293
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:13,958
but I need your help
to save this place, the TVA.

294
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:18,750
You once told me it was the only life
you'd ever known.

295
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:22,792
I sell jet skis, man.

296
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,125
Trust me.

297
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,583
- What about my boys?
- They'll be fine.

298
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:31,125
I can't leave them.

299
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:33,625
- What do you mean they'll be fine?
- I understand. Listen.

300
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:37,667
Look, you can come back anytime.

301
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:43,333
- Oh, you were at the shop earlier.
- That's right.

302
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:47,458
Yeah, you live around here
or did you follow me home...

303
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:50,208
I can bring you back to any point in time.

304
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:52,917
It'll be like you never left.

305
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:55,375
Your boys won't even know you're gone.

306
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:56,917
Yeah, but I will.

307
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:00,458
All of existence is in grave danger.

308
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:04,000
- I don't care.
- And your boys are in danger too.

309
00:24:06,542 --> 00:24:10,333
I can't keep them safe unless you help me.

310
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:19,292
You know, are you still in the market?
'Cause I... Come here.

311
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,250
What were you calling me?

312
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,458
Mobius.

313
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,333
It's a pretty cool name.

314
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:46,458
This is going to sound strange.

315
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:54,750
How you doing? I'm Don.

316
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:58,167
I guess Mobius is my space name.

317
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:01,583
Are you part of this whole...

318
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:05,583
saving the... Is this room safe?

319
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:07,875
- I wonder, for the wormhole or the...
- Yeah.

320
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:11,583
This whole area is totally abandoned.
No one's around for miles.

321
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:15,208
So, is this everyone?

322
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,750
No.

323
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:23,333
There's one more.

324
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,583
This is gonna sound strange.

325
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,375
- I know you don't know who I am.
- Loki.

326
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:10,458
- Of course I know who you are.
- What?

327
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:19,917
- You do?
- Why wouldn't I?

328
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,292
Nobody else did. Their lives were reset...

329
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:23,833
Yeah. I know. I was there.

330
00:27:25,708 --> 00:27:27,625
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

331
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:31,000
This isn't how I thought
the scene was gonna play out.

332
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,458
No? What exactly were you expect...

333
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:40,167
Okay, get in the car.

334
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:43,250
- I'm buying you a drink.
- Okay.

335
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:47,875
<i>Zaniac craves blood.</i>

336
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,958
However, Mobius's life at the TVA
was taken from him.

337
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:53,667
So was B-15's, O.B. Casey was a prisoner.

338
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,542
They don't remember who they are.

339
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:58,208
Their lives matter. They matter.

340
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:01,833
Yeah, and they're finally back
in their real lives.

341
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:03,292
That's a good thing.

342
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:08,042
- Eric, can we get a drink?
- But how many,

343
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
if they had a choice,
would have chosen to stay?

344
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:17,000
Mobius always said the TVA
was the only life he'd ever known,

345
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:18,250
and he liked it.

346
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:20,333
It gave him purpose.

347
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:22,625
It was never his choice
to begin with, Loki.

348
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:23,917
He Who Remains did that.

349
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,750
But Mobius should have a choice now, no?

350
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:29,250
Shouldn't they all?

351
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,583
To return to the TVA if they want.

352
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:34,083
No, you would be ripping people
from their lives,

353
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:36,458
showing them something
that they cannot unsee.

354
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:38,583
What kind of choice is that?

355
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:41,000
But they didn't get a choice in this

356
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:45,250
and I can't give it to them without you.

357
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:50,167
You don't care?

358
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,375
I guess not.

359
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,750
I guess this all worked out
the way you wanted it to

360
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:57,542
and you're fine just walking away.

361
00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:59,708
- It's so selfish.
- Of course I'm selfish.

362
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:01,583
I want a life.

363
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:03,667
I want to live.

364
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:08,167
What's wrong with wanting something, Loki?

365
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:10,625
What do you want?

366
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:14,958
- I want to stop He Who Remains.
- No. Wrong. Try again.

367
00:29:15,042 --> 00:29:19,250
- What is it that you really want? Come on.
- I want to save this.

368
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,500
I want to save everything. All of it.

369
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:24,792
Is it really that hard?
Come on, keep trying.

370
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:26,417
- I want to save the TVA.
- Why?

371
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,833
- I want the TVA back.
- And?

372
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:31,000
- What do you want?
- I want my friends back.

373
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:35,708
Two bourbons, please.

374
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38,042
Excellent choice, Sylvie.

375
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:42,208
I want my friends back.

376
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:46,125
I don't wanna be alone.

377
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:50,875
See? We're both selfish.

378
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:56,125
Cheers.

379
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:00,750
I know this is hard.

380
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:03,667
But your friends are back
where they belong.

381
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,875
But without them...

382
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,250
Where do I belong?

383
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,583
We're all writing our own stories now.

384
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:23,125
Go write yours.

385
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,000
How much longer are we going to be?

386
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:41,167
Some of us have
time-sensitive activities going on.

387
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,708
Don't worry. We can get you right back
where we got you.

388
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:45,292
Yeah?

389
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:49,917
So, that doodad just takes you
wherever you wanna go?

390
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:52,250
Within time and space, yeah.

391
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,292
- So like a park?
- Yeah.

392
00:30:56,292 --> 00:30:58,208
- Grand Canyon?
- Yeah.

393
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:02,250
Bank vault?

394
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,375
Do you get out on the water much?

395
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:09,500
- Swimming?
- Yeah, or personal watercraft?

396
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:13,750
No. I live in the city.
There's not much opportunity, you know?

397
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:17,292
Well, if you live on a river,
it could be an exciting way to commute.

398
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:22,583
Or, by the way, it's also nice just to
get out on a pond and unplug.

399
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:24,333
Hit that reset button.

400
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:26,958
- Well, I'll keep that in mind.
- Yeah.

401
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:30,083
Some good financing options available too.

402
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:33,875
Hey, listen,
if we're all gonna have to wait,

403
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,750
I'm gonna borrow this thing for a bit.

404
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,583
Don't bother.

405
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
You should all go home.

406
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:09,125
- Hey, Lyle.
- Hey. How's my only regular doing?

407
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:12,083
Oh, yeah, fine. Don't you ever go home?

408
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:14,167
Well, I like it here more.

409
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:17,333
Well, I'm glad of the company tonight.

410
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:23,292
- Rough day?
- Had better.

411
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:26,292
I got just the thing.

412
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:33,208
This...

413
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:38,667
will either cure what's ailing you,
or make it a whole lot worse.

414
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,583
We really need to work on
your sales technique. Thank you.

415
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:19,833
Sylvie!

416
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:21,375
You showed up and told each of us that
we're the key to saving all of existence.

417
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:23,708
And now, what? We're not?

418
00:35:23,792 --> 00:35:24,833
I'm sorry.

419
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,000
I got it wrong. All right?

420
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:30,792
It was more about what I wanted.

421
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,917
You should go back to your sons.

422
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,833
I know, but that's just it.
You said they were in danger.

423
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:40,495
- So, now they're okay?
- You should all just...

424
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:45,250
go back to your lives.
That's where you belong.

425
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:48,125
But do I need to go back
to exactly where I was?

426
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:51,083
- What about the TVA?
- The TVA.

427
00:35:54,792 --> 00:35:56,083
You're fine without it.

428
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:01,833
You're all just fine without it.

429
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:03,833
No, they aren't.

430
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:08,542
Everything's falling apart.

431
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:12,417
The branches are dying.

432
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,268
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

433
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:17,417
I don't know what's happening,
but there must be something we can do.

434
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,958
We can go back.

435
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,958
We can stop the Loom from melting down.

436
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:27,458
O.B., we're all here.

437
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:29,458
The pens...

438
00:36:31,042 --> 00:36:33,625
We have all the pens.

439
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,083
The mug, the coordinates.

440
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:41,417
Ah. Okay. First, we need to read
the collective temporal aura

441
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,333
of everyone in this room on the TemPad...

442
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,750
- Where did it go?
- Hey.

443
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:49,208
I didn't take it.

444
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:52,333
Listen, you can rob every bank
you like when this is done.

445
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:53,875
We need that TemPad now.

446
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,792
Great. But I still didn't take it.

447
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:07,917
What do we do?

448
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:14,250
It was a fiction problem.

449
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:25,333
No, no. I have to go back
to see my boys. I...

450
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,917
Is this it?

451
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:37,083
We...

452
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:41,833
There's nowhere left to go.

453
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:49,333
No. No!

454
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:53,708
<i>- It was a fiction problem.
- Everything's falling apart.</i>

455
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,833
<i>No. I have to go back to see my boys.</i>

456
00:37:56,917 --> 00:37:59,208
<i>What's wrong
with wanting something?</i>

457
00:37:59,292 --> 00:38:02,458
<i>- If I could go anywhere...
- I looked happy.</i>

458
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:06,167
<i>- Wherever it is I'm really from.
- The TVA...</i>

459
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,917
<i>Do you think that
what makes a Loki a Loki</i>

460
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,833
<i>is the fact that we're destined to lose?</i>

461
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,483
There's nowhere left to go.

462
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:32,083
No, they aren't.

463
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:34,083
Everything's falling apart.

464
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:35,500
The branches are dying.

465
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,458
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

466
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:40,667
I don't know what's happening,
but there must be something we can do.

467
00:38:42,042 --> 00:38:43,792
- I did it.
- What?

468
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:48,458
- I did it.
- Did what?

469
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,042
I controlled it.

470
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:01,833
You learned
to control your time slipping.

471
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:05,708
Yes.

472
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:11,333
It's not about where, when, or why.

473
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:23,542
It's about who.

474
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:33,417
I can rewrite the story.

475
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:34,500
<i>You died. Insert your coin, loser.</i>
