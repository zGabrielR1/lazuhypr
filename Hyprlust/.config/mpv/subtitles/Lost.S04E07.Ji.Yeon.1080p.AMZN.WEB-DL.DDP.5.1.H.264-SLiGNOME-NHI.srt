1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,936
Previously on "LOST."

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,506
You got to trust me
when I tell you this.

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:04,886
I am trying to help you.

4
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:05,586
Do I know you?

5
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,146
I'm George Minkowski.

6
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,376
I'm the communications officer.

7
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,346
Where is the radio room?

8
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,286
I'll take you there.

9
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,636
And how do we get out of here?

10
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,386
Through the door.

11
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,046
It looks like you guys
have a friend on this boat.

12
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,596
You're pregnant.

13
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,136
Juliet, she was their
fertility doctor,

14
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,486
studying pregnant women.

15
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,246
The reason the Others wanted
her baby was for research.

16
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,276
What happens to pregnant
women on this island?

17
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,286
They die.

18
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,086
You want me to help
you and your baby,

19
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,316
I have answers to
your questions.

20
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,596
But you have to come
with me, right now.

21
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,856
The baby isn't Jin's.

22
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,376
I'm going to look at
your baby and determine

23
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,196
the date of conception.

24
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,326
But if you got pregnant here?

25
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,356
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

26
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,406
The baby was conceived
about eight weeks ago.

27
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,106
You got pregnant on the island.

28
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,966
So how long do I have?

29
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,366
Most of the women
made it into the middle

30
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,296
of their second trimester.

31
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,960
Nobody made it to their third.

32
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,190
Lapidus.

33
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,106
You ready?

34
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,350
I'll be up.

35
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,850
Don't be late, Frank.

36
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,756
Regina.

37
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,466
Frank.

38
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,696
I didn't hear you.

39
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,326
Sorry, I didn't
mean to spook you.

40
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,786
The captain wanted me to
bring these guys some grub.

41
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,510
OK.

42
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,960
You know, your
book's upside down.

43
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,270
I'm just trying to help.

44
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,256
I thought I'd check in on you
guys, bring you some food.

45
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,526
How you feeling, by the way?

46
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,266
Yeah, much better, thanks.

47
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,006
Why are we being held captive?

48
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,666
We had nothing to do
with Minkowski's death.

49
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,716
This has nothing to
do with Minkowski.

50
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,056
The captain wasn't very
happy that you two decided

51
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,916
to bust out of sickbay
and into our radio room.

52
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,486
We didn't bust out.

53
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,426
The door was left open.

54
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,596
We assumed it was you.

55
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,826
Why the hell would I do that?

56
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,656
Did you have any contact
with our people on the beach?

57
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,356
No luck.

58
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,850
Something must have
happened to their phone.

59
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,986
Lima beans?

60
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:01,686
Sorry.

61
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,556
We had a little
problem in the kitchen.

62
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,530
Just stay put, all right.

63
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,166
I still want to
talk to the captain.

64
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,200
No, you don't.

65
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,636
Regina.

66
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,246
Let's talk about baby names.

67
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,086
Good.

68
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,886
We're getting better.

69
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,436
Mm, hm.

70
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,180
But no, Jin.

71
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,360
Deal.

72
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,036
Ahh.

73
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,560
Phoo, haa.

74
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,546
Ohh.

75
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,270
No.

76
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,196
What happened?

77
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:53,396
You mean before or after
the redhead knocked me out?

78
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,926
She hit you?

79
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,776
When I ran into them on the
way back from Locke's camp.

80
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,286
Why would she do that?

81
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,996
Ah, I guess she didn't want
to have to explain why she was

82
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,650
on her way to a
poison gas factory.

83
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,306
Juliet told Jack that
it's a power station.

84
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,186
Why would Juliet
lie about that?

85
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,816
Force of habit.

86
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,466
Why were they going there?

87
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,916
To turn it off,
deactivate the gas.

88
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,880
At least they wanted to
earn some brownie points.

89
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,376
Do you think they're
really going to rescue us?

90
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,716
In all the time
they've been here,

91
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,596
they talked about
a lot of things,

92
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,220
and none involved rescuing us.

93
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,226
Good morning.

94
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,216
Good morning. morning

95
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,090
I hope they resolve
their kitchen issues.

96
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,856
Sayid.

97
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,860
What's that?

98
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,746
It's a note.

99
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:25,546
Three days ago, when
I was in Locke's camp,

100
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,310
Ben claimed he had
a spy on this boat.

101
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,756
Hello.

102
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,866
My name is Sun.

103
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:50,566
Hi, Sun.

104
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,266
Hi.

105
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:59,246
I'm Daniel Something
I can help you with?

106
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,986
I'm two months pregnant.

107
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,076
Oh, you're... wow.

108
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,716
That's... congratulations.

109
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,070
So you're here to rescue us?

110
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,956
It's a simple question.

111
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,860
Are you or are you not
going to rescue us?

112
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:29,236
The thing is, um, it's
not really my call, Sun.

113
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,500
Then whose call is it?

114
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,026
Thank you.

115
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,170
Uh, can you pass,
uh, the cereal?

116
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,846
Pretty good English, Jin.

117
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,716
Thank you.

118
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,766
I understand better
than I, uh, speak.

119
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,586
Hm.

120
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,146
Has Sun been teaching you or
are you just picking it up?

121
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,146
Uh, Sun teach me.

122
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,566
Uh, Sawyer, too.

123
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,406
Sun is better.

124
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,130
I bet.

125
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,946
Hey, Sun.

126
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,156
How you feeling?

127
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,856
I'm good.

128
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,580
Thank you.

129
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,716
The morning sickness has
stopped, which has been nice.

130
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,326
That's good.

131
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,510
Well, if you need anything,
just let me know, OK.

132
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:32,930
Would you like some breakfast?

133
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,680
What are you doing?

134
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,996
I needed another
bottle of those

135
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,766
vitamins you gave me,
the, the pre-natals?

136
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,276
You could have just asked.

137
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,256
You're right, I should have.

138
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,936
What happened to the
last ones I gave you?

139
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,076
Sorry?

140
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,886
The last bottle I gave, there
should should be 20 left.

141
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,176
Are you planning a trip?

142
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,370
Please, just give
me the vitamins.

143
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,930
Where are you going, Sun?

144
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,666
We're going to Locke's camp.

145
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,390
What?

146
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,406
Why?

147
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,176
Because I don't
trust these people.

148
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,316
Whether you trust them or
not, you can't go there.

149
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,616
Locke doesn't want
to leave the island.

150
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,716
And I told you, Sun, pregnant
women, they don't survive here.

151
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,416
Yes.

152
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,346
You did tell me that.

153
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,156
You don't believe me.

154
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,036
Look, I know that I have
been less than truthful

155
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,506
about certain things
since coming here.

156
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:16,106
But I promise you,
Sun, I promise you,

157
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,716
I'm not lying about this.

158
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,526
After everything
you've confided in me,

159
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,480
I should at least
have your trust.

160
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,806
Claire's baby is fine.

161
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,566
I feel fine.

162
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,636
All I have are your stories
that I'm going to get sick.

163
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,486
I'm going to do what's best
for me and for my baby,

164
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,810
because, no, I don't trust you.

165
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,700
Oh, taxi!

166
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,030
Ahh!

167
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,736
Once you hit the stream, you
want to head northwest, pretty

168
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,366
much in a straight line
for about a day and a half.

169
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,336
Thank you.

170
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,696
I'm going to have to tell Jack.

171
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,466
But I'll give you guys
a nice, long head-start.

172
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,896
I'd tell him myself, but
he wouldn't understand.

173
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,860
No, he wouldn't.

174
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,946
You'd better get going.

175
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,496
Be safe, OK?

176
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,226
Thank you.

177
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,806
She's not going anywhere.

178
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,326
Sun, this is a bad idea.

179
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,066
What concern is it of yours?

180
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:22,816
Do you understand your wife's
medical condition right now?

181
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,216
Translate for me.

182
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,516
No.

183
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,716
Your wife is very sick.

184
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,286
If she doesn't get off
this island in three weeks,

185
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,210
she will die.

186
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,676
If you let her go,
your wife is in danger.

187
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,746
Jin, danger.

188
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,850
Wherever Sun go, I go.

189
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,520
Sun, please.

190
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,570
Jin, your wife had an affair.

191
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,846
What?

192
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,020
Sun was with another man.

193
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,040
She thought the baby was his.

194
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,596
Oh, you going fishing?

195
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,580
Uh, you mind if I tag along.

196
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,496
Oh.

197
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,526
Oh, I am sorry.

198
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,126
I, I didn't me to interrupt.

199
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:43,996
No.

200
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,306
Come.

201
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,446
You sure?

202
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,726
Yes.

203
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,450
Come.

204
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,370
You realise we're the only
tow married guys on the island?

205
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,730
Married?

206
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,036
Married.

207
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,856
Yeah, well, no,
not to each other.

208
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,066
No.

209
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,766
You got it.

210
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,236
It's not easy, is it?

211
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,536
Oh, I mean, it's,
it's wonderful.

212
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,226
But, let's face it, every
decision that you make

213
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,966
takes twice as long.

214
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,080
'Cause you always got
to talk them into it.

215
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,080
Rose has cancer.

216
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,326
She's sick.

217
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,050
Dying.

218
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,706
Well, at least she was dying.

219
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,706
She says she's better now.

220
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,890
She says it's this
place, the island.

221
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,816
But when the camp
split up, I was sure

222
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,676
that she'd want
to go with Locke.

223
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,936
Why would she want
to leave the island

224
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,246
and risk getting sick again?

225
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,696
Then why do you stay with Jack?

226
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,996
Because it was the
right thing to do.

227
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,310
Locke, he's a murderer.

228
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,906
See, it's all about karma, Jin.

229
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,340
Do you know karma?

230
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,486
You make bad choices,
bad things happen to you.

231
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,896
Or you make good choices, and
then good... hey, hey, hey, hey.

232
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,596
You got one.

233
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,736
Yeah, here, pull it in.

234
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,126
Wow, look at that.

235
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,716
Now, you see?

236
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,976
Now that's karma.

237
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,460
We must be the good guys, huh?

238
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,516
How long's that going
to go on for, eh?

239
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,576
Why don't they just fix
whatever the bloody hell

240
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,506
is causing that?

241
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,396
That sound is not mechanical.

242
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,566
What, you think
somebody's doing that?

243
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,336
Somebody is just banging
those pipes again and again?

244
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,480
That's exactly what I think.

245
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,316
Gentlemen, thanks
for your patience.

246
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,180
The captain would
like to see you now.

247
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,266
Where's the helicopter?

248
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,136
Lapidus is running an errand.

249
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,596
What kind of errand?

250
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,296
I'm a doctor.

251
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,666
I don't know where he's going.

252
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,666
Did he go to the island?

253
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,966
Do you know
anywhere else he can land?

254
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,456
What's he
going to do there?

255
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,436
I said
I'm just a doctor.

256
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,916
What did Lapidus say?

257
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,896
He didn't say anything.

258
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,876
What is he doing there?

259
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,666
Hey.

260
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,366
Hey!

261
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,090
Stop!

262
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,346
That woman just jumped
over the side of the ship.

263
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,326
Don't just stand there!

264
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,456
What's the matter
with you people?

265
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,676
What's wrong with you?
Get the rope!

266
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,256
Why aren't you doing anything?

267
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,646
Bring a rope!

268
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,576
Get the rope!

269
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,276
Get a rope!

270
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,426
Stop.

271
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,436
She just jumped.

272
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,836
It's over.

273
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,906
She's gone.

274
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,240
Everybody get back
to your posts.

275
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,410
That was an order.

276
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,986
I'm Captain Gault.

277
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,920
I suppose you two
have a few questions.

278
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,216
So what can I do for you?

279
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,056
What?

280
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,776
You boys said you
wanted to speak with me.

281
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,706
Let's just start with why
a woman jumped over the side

282
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,456
your ship and you did
nothing to stop it?

283
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,936
I didn't jump in
or order my crew

284
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,936
to jump in, because I didn't
want to lose anymore people.

285
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,650
What exactly is going on here?

286
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,666
Some of my crew have been
dealing with what might best

287
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:33,736
be described as a heightened
case of cabin fever.

288
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,776
I think it's got something to
do with the close proximity

289
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,016
of the island.

290
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,226
Why don't you turn around then?

291
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,436
I've tried.

292
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,546
But we have a saboteur on board,
and he's done one hell of a job

293
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,686
on my engines.

294
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,376
I've got my crew working around
the clock to repair them.

295
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,066
And then you'll
take our people home?

296
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:51,156
Then we move to safer waters.

297
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,156
Those are my orders.

298
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,166
And I don't suppose you'd tell
us who gave you those orders?

299
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,286
Sure, I will.

300
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,040
Charles Widmore.

301
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,766
This is Charles Widmore's boat?

302
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,910
That's right, you know him.

303
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,146
Do either of you
know what this is?

304
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:28,886
It's a flight data recorder,
otherwise known as a black box.

305
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,176
That's exactly what it is.

306
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,026
Now here's the funny
thing, this black box

307
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:41,066
comes from Oceanic Flight 815.

308
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:44,566
A salvage vessel recovered it
from the bottom of the ocean.

309
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,396
It took a considerable
amount of Mr.

310
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,186
Widmore's resources
to procure it.

311
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,816
It was found, with the
wreckage of the plane,

312
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,070
along with all 324
dead passengers.

313
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,216
That's not the complete
story, as you are well aware,

314
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,186
Mr. Jarrah, given the fact
that you're standing here,

315
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:03,910
breathing.

316
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,366
The wreckage was
obviously staged.

317
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,346
Now, can you imagine what
kind of resources and manpower

318
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,406
go into pulling off a
feat of that magnitude?

319
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:19,216
Faking the recovery
of a plane crash?

320
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,466
Putting 324 families
through a grieving process

321
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,246
based on a lie?

322
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,656
But what's even more
disturbing, where exactly

323
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:34,306
does one come across
324 dead bodies?

324
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:37,546
And that, Mr. Jarrah,
Mr. Hume, is just one

325
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,240
of the many reasons we
want Benjamin Linus.

326
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,076
I'm sorry.

327
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,800
I had to stop you
any way I could.

328
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,956
It wasn't your
place to stop us.

329
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,056
I know you don't trust me.

330
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,376
But you need to get
off this island.

331
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,256
We all do.

332
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,476
You want to leave?

333
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,736
More than anything.

334
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,246
I don't know if that boat out
there is the answer or not,

335
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,336
but it's something.

336
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,786
I need to go home.

337
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,746
So do you.

338
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:30,766
Sun, in about
three weeks, you'll

339
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,976
be in almost constant
state of nausea.

340
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,786
A week after that,
you'll experience

341
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,896
shortness of breath
that won't go away.

342
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,966
A week after that, you'll
consciousness and slip

343
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:47,526
into a coma and then,
Sun, you will die.

344
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:52,350
And when your heart stops
beating so will the baby's.

345
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,636
And that, Sun, is why
it is my business.

346
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,720
Because you are my patient.

347
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:10,566
If you go, you will die.

348
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,070
And your baby will
never be born.

349
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,980
Eahh

350
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:26,650
Ahhh.

351
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,506
So what did you
think of the captain?

352
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,776
He was surprisingly
forthcoming.

353
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,886
Yeah, he tells it like it is.

354
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,446
Just don't piss him off.

355
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,936
You know what I mean?

356
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,936
I think you'll like your room.

357
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,606
It's on the quiet
part of the ship.

358
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,296
This ship is moving.

359
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,340
Well, if you say so.

360
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,596
That shouldn't still be there.

361
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,320
Damn it.

362
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:50,176
Hey, Johnson, is that you?

363
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,196
Johnson?

364
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,666
Yeah.

365
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,516
Mop this up.

366
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,976
Sorry, I got to go up on deck.

367
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,600
No, you're going
to mop this up.

368
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:24,006
Kevin, this is, uh,

369
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,730
Sayid.

00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,036
Desmond.

371
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:29,760
Kevin Johnson.

372
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,370
Nice to meet you, Kevin.

373
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,000
I made dinner.

374
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,660

375
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,166

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,660
Hm heh.

378
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:12,226
I can't believe you
came all this way.

379
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,566
Are you kidding?

380
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,656
Is anyone else coming?

381
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,096
No.

382
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:23,936
Good So where is she?

383
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,746

00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:28,616

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,046
She's awesome.

386
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:30,770
Thank you.

387
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,926
Would you like to hold her?

388
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,626
I don't know.

389
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:40,226
I, I kind of have
two left hands.

390
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,170
I trust you.

391
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,636
Wow.

392
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,086
She looks just like Jin.

393
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,230
Yes, she does.

394
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:07,006
So, I guess we should,
like, go see him.

395
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,780
Of course.

396
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,186
Bad Robot.
