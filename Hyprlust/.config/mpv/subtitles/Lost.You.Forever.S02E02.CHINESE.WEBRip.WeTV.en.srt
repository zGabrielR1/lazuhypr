=Lost You Forever S2=

2
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,592
=Episode 2=

3
00:01:34,346 --> 00:01:35,466
The Central Plains

4
00:01:35,865 --> 00:01:36,706
are indeed prosperous.

5
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,945
No wonder His Majesty wishes
to establish the capital here.

6
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:42,185
Being sentimental

7
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:43,986
is a fatal for a man.

8
00:01:44,545 --> 00:01:45,505
That boy Cang Xuan

9
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:47,945
is not as ambitious and intimidating

10
00:01:47,945 --> 00:01:49,026
as the old King of Xiyan.

11
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:50,706
Back then...

12
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,146
Xiyan braised mutton.

13
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:02,026
Gu Shu grilled silkworms.

14
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,625
There's a story
about this braised mutton.

15
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:06,746
When the Great Emperor

16
00:02:06,746 --> 00:02:07,545
won a big victory

17
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,625
in a battle,

18
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:10,346
he rewarded the three armies.

19
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:12,025
As it was cold,

20
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,346
he stewed the mutton

21
00:02:13,506 --> 00:02:14,226
in a big pot

22
00:02:14,346 --> 00:02:15,986
and shared it with the soldiers.

23
00:02:16,545 --> 00:02:18,185
And the dish Gu Shu grilled silkworms

24
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,066
was created by Queen Xiezu.

25
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,346
It looks frightening,

26
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:23,346
but it's rich

27
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:24,586
in nutrients.

28
00:02:26,265 --> 00:02:27,346
I didn't expect

29
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:29,625
to eat authentic Xiyan dishes
in Central Plains.

30
00:02:30,786 --> 00:02:31,786
Get the cook here,

31
00:02:31,946 --> 00:02:32,825
and I'll reward him well.

32
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:34,448
Yes.

33
00:02:37,506 --> 00:02:38,625
It's been a long time

34
00:02:38,745 --> 00:02:40,306
since I've eaten
such authentic Xiyan food.

35
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:41,745
If it were not for Cang Xuan,

36
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,786
we would be drinking and eating at home.

37
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,786
Come on. Let's drink.

38
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:47,786
Eat.

39
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:49,586
This tastes good.

40
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:50,320
So authentic.

41
00:02:50,426 --> 00:02:51,786
It's the taste of Xiyan.

42
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:55,226
Everyone.

43
00:02:56,465 --> 00:02:57,025
This is the cook

44
00:02:57,706 --> 00:03:00,025
who prepared the dishes for you.

45
00:03:00,506 --> 00:03:01,066
Please.

46
00:03:10,185 --> 00:03:12,506
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

47
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:13,346
Rise.

48
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:18,946
Please get up.

49
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,226
Please rise.

50
00:03:20,385 --> 00:03:22,745
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

51
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:23,786
No offense.

52
00:03:24,185 --> 00:03:24,946
I really don't know

53
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:26,586
Your Majesty made these dishes.

54
00:03:28,665 --> 00:03:29,825
Because of me,

55
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:31,545
all of you had to leave home

56
00:03:31,786 --> 00:03:33,786
and come all the way
to the Central Plains.

57
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:35,745
You can't even

58
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:36,706
eat hometown food here.

59
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:37,825
I'm sorry about that.

60
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:39,825
I made these dishes

61
00:03:40,786 --> 00:03:43,146
as my apology to you all.

62
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,946
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

63
00:03:46,946 --> 00:03:48,346
I'm not an emperor today,

64
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:49,786
but a kid.

65
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:52,426
You're my elders.
Please make yourselves at home.

66
00:03:53,105 --> 00:03:53,786
Please sit down.

67
00:03:57,866 --> 00:03:58,706
Please.

68
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,706
- Yes.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

69
00:04:05,465 --> 00:04:06,426
Mr. Huhe.

70
00:04:06,426 --> 00:04:07,706
What do you think of the dishes?

71
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:09,545
Good.

72
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:11,226
Especially the grilled silkworms

73
00:04:11,346 --> 00:04:12,306
taste as good

74
00:04:12,346 --> 00:04:13,946
as what Lady Xiezu cooked.

75
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:16,306
Do you all remember?

76
00:04:16,746 --> 00:04:17,385
That year,

77
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:19,225
we ventured deep into the enemy's camp,

78
00:04:19,586 --> 00:04:20,426
ran out of food

79
00:04:20,545 --> 00:04:21,626
and were seriously injured.

80
00:04:21,986 --> 00:04:23,945
But we survived

81
00:04:24,105 --> 00:04:25,225
on the silkworms raised

82
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:26,426
by Lady Xiezu.

83
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:27,505
Indeed.

84
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:29,466
The queen was merciful.

85
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:30,345
Back then,

86
00:04:30,626 --> 00:04:31,785
each soldier

87
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:33,306
serving the Great Emperor

88
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,105
owed Her Highness.

89
00:04:36,505 --> 00:04:37,545
- Yes, indeed.
- Yes.

90
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,225
I heard a lot about you

91
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:41,866
from my grandmother.

92
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:44,265
In the past, Xiyan's territory

93
00:04:44,265 --> 00:04:45,385
covered the North and Xi Jiang.

94
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:48,026
Now the territory is vast,

95
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:50,065
stretching from Yuyuan in the west

96
00:04:50,505 --> 00:04:53,345
to the Donghai Sea,
governing most of Dahuang.

97
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:55,626
It all thanks to

98
00:04:56,626 --> 00:04:58,065
your deeds of valor in battle.

99
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:00,026
You insist on staying
in the Central Plains.

100
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:01,265
I thought

101
00:05:01,906 --> 00:05:03,505
you were captivated

102
00:05:03,505 --> 00:05:04,586
by its prosperity

103
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:07,345
and forgot the past hardships.

104
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:08,825
I've decided to stay here

105
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:10,986
not because I've forgotten the past.

106
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:12,186
I'm walking

107
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:14,466
the same path my grandparents took,

108
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:16,866
leading the Xiyan clans

109
00:05:18,505 --> 00:05:20,105
to make Xiyan thrive

110
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:22,785
and give people a peaceful life.

111
00:05:22,986 --> 00:05:25,306
I've never forgotten your contributions

112
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:28,105
to the country.

113
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,545
My men asked around.

114
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:35,866
It is true.

115
00:05:48,105 --> 00:05:50,225
To please those old folks,

116
00:05:50,545 --> 00:05:52,586
(Xiyan Shiran)
Cang Xuan shamelessly cooked for them.

117
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:55,866
He humiliated himself.

118
00:05:58,665 --> 00:06:00,065
Cang Xuan is scheming.

119
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:02,825
He might have

120
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:04,306
won over those old folks

121
00:06:04,306 --> 00:06:06,065
by a carrot-and-stick approach.

122
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:07,986
Brother.

123
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:10,906
We can no longer stay
in the Central Plains.

124
00:06:11,385 --> 00:06:12,306
Instead of enduring

125
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:14,345
Cang Xuan's arrogance,

126
00:06:14,746 --> 00:06:15,426
why not

127
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:17,265
fight him together?

128
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:20,945
While the old clans still support us,

129
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:21,866
take the chance

130
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:23,866
to oppose the capital relocation

131
00:06:24,345 --> 00:06:25,545
and lead them back to Xiyan.

132
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,626
Just let Cang Xuan stay here

133
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:30,065
and be the king.

134
00:06:31,906 --> 00:06:32,586
Plus,

135
00:06:33,986 --> 00:06:34,945
you can take this chance

136
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:37,186
to make yourself king

137
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:38,706
in Xiyan Town.

138
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,186
Brother.

139
00:06:41,746 --> 00:06:42,906
It's a rare opportunity.

140
00:06:43,105 --> 00:06:44,265
If Cang Xuan

141
00:06:44,345 --> 00:06:46,026
wins over the clans

142
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,545
and secures his throne,

143
00:06:47,746 --> 00:06:48,586
I'm afraid

144
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,426
we will have no more chances.

145
00:07:01,808 --> 00:07:02,385
Okay.

146
00:07:04,186 --> 00:07:04,746
Shiran.

147
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:07,906
You invite the leaders

148
00:07:09,026 --> 00:07:11,945
of each clan to come
and discuss matters.

149
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:15,626
Let's return to Xiyan Town together.

150
00:07:16,665 --> 00:07:17,168
Yes.

151
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:18,785
When you have time,

152
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:21,345
we'll go to Baili

153
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:23,706
to remove the poisonous bug.

154
00:07:27,385 --> 00:07:28,026
Rest assured.

155
00:07:28,785 --> 00:07:29,785
After that,

156
00:07:30,706 --> 00:07:31,906
I will still keep my promise

157
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:32,665
to you.

158
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:38,545
Alright.

159
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:39,906
When I have time.

160
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:47,825
I'll deliver the pills to you

161
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:48,545
every three months.

162
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:50,385
I have to go.

163
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:00,706
Join me for a meal.

164
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:10,545
Sorry, but I don't have time.

165
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,706
You better not

166
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:16,345
refuse my invitation.

167
00:08:18,345 --> 00:08:19,825
But now you are Fangfeng Bei.

168
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:21,626
So who were you

169
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,345
talking to just now?

170
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:24,496
Alright.

171
00:08:25,146 --> 00:08:26,265
General Xiang Liu.

172
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:30,586
What kind of meat is this?

173
00:08:30,825 --> 00:08:31,440
It smells so good.

174
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,688
Donkey meat.

175
00:08:34,705 --> 00:08:35,465
In Dahuang,

176
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:37,186
no one is better at cooking donkey meat

177
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:38,905
than him.

178
00:08:40,665 --> 00:08:41,746
What a surprise.

179
00:08:43,506 --> 00:08:44,426
It's been centuries.

180
00:08:44,705 --> 00:08:46,266
You came with a friend
for the first time.

181
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:48,266
(Mr. Lirong)
A girl, even.

182
00:08:50,986 --> 00:08:52,066
It's made especially for you.

183
00:08:52,624 --> 00:08:53,200
Try it.

184
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:54,224
Thank you.

185
00:08:58,785 --> 00:08:59,905
A while ago,

186
00:09:00,785 --> 00:09:02,746
two more brothers left us.

187
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:05,465
Those who followed Chi...

188
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:08,866
Followed the general

189
00:09:09,785 --> 00:09:11,105
have almost all died.

190
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:12,626
Every man will die

191
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:14,826
sooner or later.

192
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:16,946
You are right.

193
00:09:17,626 --> 00:09:18,866
Maybe one day,

194
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:20,465
you and I will die.

195
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:28,705
Look at you.

196
00:09:29,386 --> 00:09:30,345
When she's around you,

197
00:09:30,506 --> 00:09:32,105
you don't even dare

198
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:32,656
to approach her.

199
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:33,665
Now,

200
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:34,986
she left with another man.

201
00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:36,785
And it makes you upset.

202
00:09:40,986 --> 00:09:42,826
What can I do even if I approach her?

203
00:09:56,506 --> 00:09:59,066
What a small world, Jing.

204
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:00,665
What do you say?

205
00:10:11,306 --> 00:10:12,665
What's your name, young lady?

206
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:20,306
Young lady.

207
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:21,866
Fangfeng Bei

208
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:23,506
is as bad

209
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:24,866
as that old stallholder.

210
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:26,345
He's not the right one.

211
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:27,585
Why not

212
00:10:28,225 --> 00:10:28,905
be with my buddy?

213
00:10:30,665 --> 00:10:31,506
My buddy

214
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:32,266
was set up

215
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,225
by a woman

216
00:10:33,506 --> 00:10:34,465
and got her pregnant.

217
00:10:34,946 --> 00:10:35,472
However,

218
00:10:35,665 --> 00:10:36,386
that's not

219
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,705
an unforgivable mistake, right?

220
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:39,665
Lirong Chang!

221
00:10:43,186 --> 00:10:44,186
Just think about it.

222
00:10:44,626 --> 00:10:46,746
He made a mistake.

223
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:48,506
So he won't make the same mistake

224
00:10:48,506 --> 00:10:49,386
again.

225
00:10:49,626 --> 00:10:50,986
After getting married, you'll have less

226
00:10:51,105 --> 00:10:52,066
to worry about.

227
00:10:52,905 --> 00:10:53,785
Are you done?

228
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:55,306
No.

229
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:56,986
Young lady.

230
00:10:58,186 --> 00:10:59,665
To be honest,

231
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:02,145
Fangfeng Bei

232
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:03,746
can't give you a stable life.

233
00:11:04,145 --> 00:11:05,746
Though Tushan Jing made a mistake,

234
00:11:05,905 --> 00:11:07,465
he's still better than Fangfeng Bei.

235
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:11,105
I'm already engaged.

236
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:12,866
He is not my fiancé.

237
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:15,186
So, please.

238
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:17,266
Stop belittling others.

239
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:22,025
Engaged?

240
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:23,408
To whom?

241
00:11:23,905 --> 00:11:25,426
Who dares to take my buddy's woman?

242
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,066
Tell me his name.

243
00:11:27,345 --> 00:11:28,306
I'll talk to him right now.

244
00:11:28,465 --> 00:11:29,545
If he doesn't call it off,

245
00:11:29,785 --> 00:11:31,145
I'll break his legs.

246
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:32,746
Chishui Fenglong.

247
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:34,905
Go talk to him.

248
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:36,368
Feng...

249
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:40,826
You are Fenglong's fiancée?

250
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,448
So,

251
00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:48,066
you are

252
00:11:48,746 --> 00:11:50,266
Princess of Haoling?

253
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:52,626
King of Xiyan's sister?

254
00:11:55,585 --> 00:11:56,986
You are quite polite to him.

255
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,426
What he said is true.

256
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,105
I'm not a good man

257
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:03,145
for any woman.

258
00:12:04,105 --> 00:12:04,905
You know it.

259
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:09,306
You're the daughter of Princess General?

260
00:12:11,986 --> 00:12:12,866
And your father?

261
00:12:13,426 --> 00:12:14,585
I am the Princess of Haoling.

262
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:16,306
So, my father is the King of Haoling.

he loves to sing random folk songs.

00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:31,266
Lirong Chang knows your identity.

294
00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:35,585
That one-armed old man

295
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:37,145
is his uncle.

296
00:14:38,426 --> 00:14:40,345
He was once a general under Chi Chen.

297
00:14:41,785 --> 00:14:43,186
He took part in the battle of Jizhou?

298
00:14:45,905 --> 00:14:46,826
His arm was lost

299
00:14:47,306 --> 00:14:49,066
in the battle of Jizhou.

300
00:14:51,626 --> 00:14:52,465
Today,

301
00:14:52,465 --> 00:14:53,986
things changed in the Central Plains.

302
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:55,746
Be careful.

303
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,506
Are you worried about my safety?

304
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:04,345
What are you thinking?

305
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:07,145
I'm just casually reminding you.

306
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:09,105
I think

307
00:15:09,105 --> 00:15:10,465
you should worry about yourself.

308
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:13,066
Myself?

309
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:14,465
What about me?

310
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:15,545
I'm pretty good.

311
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:16,785
Yes.

312
00:15:17,145 --> 00:15:18,946
You're doing so well.

313
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:20,705
That's why you gamble alone

314
00:15:20,705 --> 00:15:21,905
at the casino.

315
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:51,705
Why is it so hard

316
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:53,306
to find a companion?

317
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:01,145
It's not that hard.

318
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:05,465
Yet it's indeed hard to find someone

319
00:16:06,826 --> 00:16:08,025
with similar tastes,

320
00:16:09,746 --> 00:16:10,665
who treats you sincerely

321
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:12,306
and makes your life interesting.

322
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:15,426
Can a person not forget someone

323
00:16:15,426 --> 00:16:16,705
for a lifetime?

324
00:16:19,826 --> 00:16:20,866
That depends on who it is.

325
00:16:22,426 --> 00:16:23,386
If you're talking

326
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:24,186
about Tushan Jing,

327
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:28,105
I think it's very possible.

328
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,186
Are you saying he can't forget me?

329
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:34,426
Or I can't forget him?

330
00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:37,105
It's up to you.

331
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:42,746
Anyway, there are plenty of good men.

332
00:16:45,986 --> 00:16:47,465
There are many good men.

333
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:48,946
But,

334
00:16:50,746 --> 00:16:52,705
a few of them will stay true

What do you mean by that?

337
00:16:58,986 --> 00:17:00,066
Do you think

338
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:02,266
I shouldn't marry Chishui Fenglong?

339
00:17:02,626 --> 00:17:03,386
I don't mean anything.

00:17:55,225 --> 00:17:56,866

00:19:41,906 --> 00:19:43,465
happens to have a banquet today.

387
00:19:43,626 --> 00:19:45,185
They have all gone to his banquet.

388
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:52,465
He holds a banquet too?

389
00:19:52,786 --> 00:19:54,065
He did it on purpose.

390
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:56,546
He is deliberately against me.

391
00:19:59,065 --> 00:19:59,786
(Your Majesty.)

392
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,305
Establish a capital,
and the country will be stable.

393
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:03,506
Relocating the capital

394
00:20:03,506 --> 00:20:04,425
must be done quickly.

395
00:20:04,506 --> 00:20:06,945
Please make a decision, Your Majesty.

396
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:07,585
Your Majesty.

397
00:20:07,746 --> 00:20:09,666
Now, the territory of Xiyan is vast.

398
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,465
And Zhiyi is in the heart of it

399
00:20:11,705 --> 00:20:13,626
and more suitable to be the capital.

400
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:15,626
I also agree to move the capital.

401
00:20:16,546 --> 00:20:17,546
Agreed.

402
00:20:17,906 --> 00:20:18,866
Move the Zhiyi,

403
00:20:18,866 --> 00:20:20,746
and it'll facilitate governance.

404
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,626
Agreed.

405
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:23,626
Agreed.

406
00:20:23,626 --> 00:20:25,506
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

407
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:31,386
Agreed.

408
00:20:31,386 --> 00:20:33,546
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

409
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,866
Agreed.

410
00:20:36,225 --> 00:20:37,305
I object.

411
00:20:37,345 --> 00:20:38,425
I object.

412
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:40,146
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

413
00:20:40,146 --> 00:20:42,705
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

414
00:20:45,425 --> 00:20:46,026
Yu Jiang.

415
00:20:46,185 --> 00:20:46,746
Yes?

416
00:20:46,906 --> 00:20:47,786
I command you

417
00:20:47,986 --> 00:20:49,906
to oversee the matter
of relocating the capital.

418
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,506
(Yu Jiang)

419
00:20:51,506 --> 00:20:53,026
(Yu Jiang)
Yes, Your Majesty.

420
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:57,546
- Your Majesty is wise.
- Your Majesty is wise.

421
00:21:00,305 --> 00:21:01,705
Uncles.

422
00:21:04,386 --> 00:21:06,225
Do you have any problems?

423
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:25,866
- Your Majesty is wise.
- Your Majesty is wise.

424
00:21:36,585 --> 00:21:37,986
You handled it very well

425
00:21:38,146 --> 00:21:40,105
in the matter of relocating the capital.

426
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,626
Thank you

427
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:43,506
for leaving the Shangyang clan
and the others

428
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:44,266
to me.

429
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:45,786
If it weren't for them,

430
00:21:46,026 --> 00:21:47,465
things wouldn't have gone so smoothly.

431
00:21:47,986 --> 00:21:49,506
I give them to you.

432
00:21:50,345 --> 00:21:52,626
But it's your decision

433
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:55,345
on how to use them.

434
00:21:55,825 --> 00:21:57,105
No need to think of me.

435
00:21:57,546 --> 00:21:58,506
Yes, I see.

436
00:22:00,425 --> 00:22:01,986
The emperor wields power

437
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:04,425
and is also driven by power.

438
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:05,746
You chose this path

439
00:22:05,746 --> 00:22:07,185
yourself.

440
00:22:07,185 --> 00:22:08,185
There is no way back.

441
00:22:08,506 --> 00:22:11,225
And you cannot

442
00:22:11,585 --> 00:22:12,506
even stop.

443
00:22:13,546 --> 00:22:15,425
You have to push forward.

444
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:18,225
Yes.

445
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:20,465
I understand.

446
00:22:23,986 --> 00:22:24,746
Father.

447
00:22:24,986 --> 00:22:26,585
I long for the homeland.

448
00:22:27,425 --> 00:22:28,546
I have already told His Majesty

449
00:22:29,465 --> 00:22:31,866
we're going to return to Xiyan Mountain.

450
00:22:31,945 --> 00:22:34,906
Have you decided?

451
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:37,705
I originally couldn't admit defeat.

452
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:39,305
But Cang Xuan has been recognized.

453
00:22:39,305 --> 00:22:40,345
We will humiliate ourselves

454
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:41,506
if we don't give up.

455
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,065
It's better to let it go

456
00:22:43,386 --> 00:22:44,666
and enjoy my life.

457
00:22:45,185 --> 00:22:46,266
At least, I can end well.

458
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:54,425
Okay.

459
00:22:54,945 --> 00:22:57,345
It's not too late for you

460
00:22:57,986 --> 00:22:59,026
to figure it out.

461
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:00,386
As long as the two of you

462
00:23:00,705 --> 00:23:02,026
don't do anything wilder,

463
00:23:02,425 --> 00:23:03,225
Cang Xuan

464
00:23:03,945 --> 00:23:05,786
will not give you a hard time.

465
00:23:13,866 --> 00:23:14,825
In the future,

466
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:16,185
I can't accompany you.

467
00:23:16,546 --> 00:23:19,146
Father, please take care of your health.

468
00:23:25,945 --> 00:23:26,986
Rise.

469
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,945
- I take my leave.
- I take my leave.

470
00:24:28,465 --> 00:24:29,305
Xie.

471
00:24:30,266 --> 00:24:32,906
Our grandson has done very well,

472
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:36,266
better than I expected.

473
00:24:37,705 --> 00:24:38,825
He convinced them with emotion

474
00:24:39,065 --> 00:24:40,225
and won them over with benefits.

475
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:41,825
It's a carrot-and-stick approach.

476
00:24:43,345 --> 00:24:44,225
Originally,

477
00:24:44,506 --> 00:24:45,305
I thought

478
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:47,825
my two good-for-nothing sons

479
00:24:48,746 --> 00:24:51,386
would be sacrificed for the country.

480
00:24:53,185 --> 00:24:53,986
Unexpectedly,

481
00:24:54,746 --> 00:24:55,825
things end

482
00:24:55,986 --> 00:24:57,225
without bloodshed.

483
00:24:58,465 --> 00:25:00,705
The two of them

484
00:25:00,786 --> 00:25:02,386
end up well.

485
00:25:07,225 --> 00:25:08,425
I feel happy today.

486
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:11,105
Have a drink with me.

487
00:25:13,986 --> 00:25:14,506
Come on.

488
00:25:44,425 --> 00:25:45,425
Greetings, Your Majesty.

489
00:25:45,626 --> 00:25:46,506
No need for that.

490
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:48,585
I made some pastries

491
00:25:48,585 --> 00:25:49,986
that you like.

492
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:55,626
His Majesty can't eat unexpected food.

493
00:25:56,065 --> 00:25:56,945
I must do poison testing,

494
00:25:57,465 --> 00:25:58,705
and then someone tastes it.

495
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:14,386
You don't have to.

496
00:26:15,026 --> 00:26:15,666
Thank you, anyway.

497
00:26:15,945 --> 00:26:16,746
I haven't done enough

498
00:26:16,906 --> 00:26:18,626
for you yet.

499
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:19,945
These days,

500
00:26:20,105 --> 00:26:21,465
you've been on the line.

501
00:26:21,585 --> 00:26:22,585
It's life and death.

502
00:26:22,786 --> 00:26:24,026
I've also been anxious,

503
00:26:24,185 --> 00:26:25,266
fidgeting about.

504
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:27,065
But I couldn't help.

505
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:28,546
I could only remind

506
00:26:28,585 --> 00:26:29,986
myself of the promise we made.

507
00:26:33,585 --> 00:26:34,185
The promise?

508
00:26:34,465 --> 00:26:35,386
Has Your Majesty forgotten?

509
00:26:36,506 --> 00:26:37,705
We promised

510
00:26:38,345 --> 00:26:39,146
that whatever happened,

511
00:26:39,386 --> 00:26:40,266
I would be with you.

512
00:26:40,585 --> 00:26:42,026
Fortunately, Your Majesty was blessed

513
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:44,185
and ascended the throne smoothly.

514
00:26:44,425 --> 00:26:45,986
Finally,

515
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,305
I felt relieved.

516
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:49,266
Whatever happens,

517
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:52,305
you'll be with me?

518
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:55,945
Yes, I only have an eye for you.

519
00:26:56,626 --> 00:26:58,705
I'll be with you whatever happens.

520
00:27:05,904 --> 00:27:07,888
(The memorial from Chishui Fenglong)

521
00:27:08,225 --> 00:27:09,746
(The emperor wields power)

522
00:27:09,945 --> 00:27:11,585
(and is also driven by power.)

523
00:27:12,185 --> 00:27:14,506
(You chose this path yourself.)

524
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:15,705
(There is no way back.)

525
00:27:16,425 --> 00:27:19,225
(And you cannot)

526
00:27:19,386 --> 00:27:20,185
(even stop.)

527
00:27:20,746 --> 00:27:22,585
(You have to push forward.)

528
00:27:24,425 --> 00:27:25,185
Your Majesty?

529
00:27:41,906 --> 00:27:42,666
I understand.

530
00:27:48,425 --> 00:27:48,986
Your Majesty.

531
00:27:49,146 --> 00:27:49,945
The poison testing?

532
00:27:50,105 --> 00:27:50,705
No need.

533
00:27:59,065 --> 00:27:59,825
It tastes good.

534
00:28:01,345 --> 00:28:02,465
If you like it,

535
00:28:02,786 --> 00:28:04,225
I will make more.

536
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:11,026
Here's one thing

537
00:28:11,705 --> 00:28:13,146
I want you to do.

538
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,425
I'm listening, Grandfather.

539
00:28:14,425 --> 00:28:15,386
Can you find a way

540
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,746
to persuade Xiang Liu to surrender?

541
00:28:17,786 --> 00:28:18,945
Persuading Xiang Liu to surrender?

542
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,705
It's difficult.

543
00:28:24,986 --> 00:28:26,225
It's very difficult.

544
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:27,945
For centuries,

545
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:29,705
Deyan and Chenrong Yi

546
00:28:30,026 --> 00:28:31,786
have both tried.

547
00:28:32,146 --> 00:28:33,786
But they were rejected.

548
00:28:33,986 --> 00:28:35,546
Still, I hope

549
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,626
you will have a try.

550
00:28:37,945 --> 00:28:39,546
If it's accomplished,

551
00:28:40,146 --> 00:28:41,546
it'll good to the country
and the people.

552
00:28:42,026 --> 00:28:42,945
I will appoint someone

553
00:28:42,945 --> 00:28:44,506
clever and capable
to deal with this matter

554
00:28:45,105 --> 00:28:46,266
and make every effort to do it.

555
00:28:49,305 --> 00:28:49,840
Good.

556
00:28:58,305 --> 00:28:59,425
This is not a place

557
00:28:59,425 --> 00:29:00,185
for Chief Lirong.

558
00:29:02,626 --> 00:29:03,906
I actually think

559
00:29:04,345 --> 00:29:06,146
I'm the right person to be here.

560
00:29:10,672 --> 00:29:12,666
(Xiang Liu)

561
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:13,520
Go ahead.

562
00:29:14,065 --> 00:29:14,666
What is it?

563
00:29:17,616 --> 00:29:19,425
His Majesty asked me
to persuade you to surrender.

564
00:29:26,786 --> 00:29:27,585
Do you know the fate

565
00:29:29,105 --> 00:29:31,225
of the last person
who did the same thing?

566
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:32,225
Of course, I do.

567
00:29:32,945 --> 00:29:33,945
But I have to come.

568
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:36,786
As an envoy of Xiyan,

569
00:29:37,105 --> 00:29:38,506
I'm here to persuade you to surrender.

570
00:29:39,305 --> 00:29:40,305
But as your friend,

571
00:29:41,506 --> 00:29:42,825
I advise you spare yourself.

572
00:29:44,105 --> 00:29:45,026
Spare myself?

573
00:29:46,225 --> 00:29:46,825
I know.

574
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:48,986
You helped Hong Jiang

575
00:29:49,305 --> 00:29:50,345
to repay his kindness.

576
00:29:50,945 --> 00:29:52,305
I don't think

577
00:29:52,465 --> 00:29:54,026
you'll change sides and serve Xiyan.

578
00:29:54,386 --> 00:29:54,928
However,

579
00:29:56,065 --> 00:29:58,146
you can take this opportunity to secede.

580
00:29:58,746 --> 00:29:59,945
I secede?

581
00:30:02,945 --> 00:30:04,546
You have already served Hong Jiang

582
00:30:04,546 --> 00:30:05,305
for centuries.

583
00:30:06,185 --> 00:30:07,105
No matter what,

584
00:30:07,225 --> 00:30:08,026
you don't owe him now.

585
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:09,305
Why not take this chance

586
00:30:09,305 --> 00:30:10,425
to unload this heavy burden?

587
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:13,305
And you can live in seclusion

588
00:30:13,305 --> 00:30:14,386
or wander the world.

589
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,305
Do whatever you want.

590
00:30:19,506 --> 00:30:21,266
Even if you meet someone you like,

591
00:30:22,465 --> 00:30:25,386
you can marry her, have children,
and spend your life with her.

592
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,266
It's a joyful life.

593
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:31,185
Grandpa.

594
00:30:31,305 --> 00:30:32,026
Grandpa.

595
00:30:32,185 --> 00:30:33,026
Grandpa.

596
00:30:33,506 --> 00:30:35,425
Grandpa, let me help you.

597
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:36,624
Good kid.

598
00:30:36,624 --> 00:30:37,225
Let's go.

599
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:38,305
I'll make you something tasty.

600
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:40,065
Granny, I'll support you.

601
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:41,225
Okay, let's go.

602
00:30:42,896 --> 00:30:43,824
Come on.

603
00:30:44,144 --> 00:30:45,585
(Rejuvenation Hall, Qingshui Town)

604
00:30:45,585 --> 00:30:47,185
Shall we go back to eat?

605
00:31:04,866 --> 00:31:06,065
If you have any requests,

606
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:07,465
just let me know.

607
00:31:08,105 --> 00:31:09,626
The King of Xiyan will try
to fulfill you.

608
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:12,225
No need.

609
00:31:17,026 --> 00:31:17,746
Go back.

610
00:31:28,746 --> 00:31:30,146
You stubborn nine-headed demon.

611
00:31:30,825 --> 00:31:31,906
What is it that you really want?

612
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:33,585
You know what happened

613
00:31:33,585 --> 00:31:34,386
to Chi Chen.

614
00:31:34,786 --> 00:31:36,386
He staked his life
for the Central Plains.

615
00:31:36,386 --> 00:31:37,185
And now?

616
00:31:37,386 --> 00:31:38,266
No one remembers him.

617
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,026
Haven't you seen

618
00:31:40,026 --> 00:31:40,945
the kind of life

619
00:31:40,945 --> 00:31:41,986
my uncle is living?

620
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:45,185
This is a path doomed to failure.

621
00:31:46,266 --> 00:31:47,746
What are you holding on to?

622
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:13,026
The mountains and rivers remain,

623
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:16,786
but the old friends are gone.

♪Let my blood flood the wilderness♪

631
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:15,185
This is General Chi Chen's love song

632

for his wife.

633
00:33:17,146 --> 00:33:18,585
Where did you hear it?

634
00:33:19,026 --> 00:33:19,546
Baili.

635
00:33:26,585 --> 00:33:28,266
Did the girl who came with you

636
00:33:29,585 --> 00:33:31,305
put the poisonous bug in you?

637
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:33,666
Why?

638
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,465
You should not see her anymore.

639
00:33:39,705 --> 00:33:40,465
Go to Baili.

640
00:33:41,705 --> 00:33:44,345
Wu King can remove it from you.

641
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:48,906
The Baili people are eccentric.

642
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,345
They don't like to deal with strangers.

643
00:33:53,225 --> 00:33:53,906
Why will the Wu King

644
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,225
help a stranger?

645
00:33:55,585 --> 00:33:56,146
He will.

646
00:33:57,305 --> 00:33:58,705
As long as he sees that girl,

647
00:33:58,705 --> 00:33:59,705
he will definitely help you.

648
00:34:00,185 --> 00:34:01,386
That girl is...

649
00:34:08,385 --> 00:34:09,306
What?

650
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,145
Never mind.

651
00:34:13,905 --> 00:34:15,225
Great Princess of Haoling

652
00:34:16,865 --> 00:34:17,786
and Chi Chen,

653
00:34:19,986 --> 00:34:21,266
what exactly is their relationship?

654
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:29,826
It will not work out.

655
00:34:30,865 --> 00:34:31,945
You better let her go.

656
00:34:32,145 --> 00:34:33,586
Your positions are different.

657
00:34:34,945 --> 00:34:36,905
Don't end up like the general.

658
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:38,385
He was in love with a woman

659
00:34:38,746 --> 00:34:40,546
but had to fight her to the death

660
00:34:40,546 --> 00:34:41,986
on the battlefield.

661
00:34:48,865 --> 00:34:49,465
You two

662
00:34:50,705 --> 00:34:51,905
have different positions.

663
00:34:52,306 --> 00:34:54,066
It's doomed to have no good outcome.

664
00:34:54,705 --> 00:34:55,905
You better stop.

665
00:34:56,465 --> 00:34:57,225
Let her go.

666
00:34:58,385 --> 00:34:59,826
Don't see her again.

667
00:35:00,546 --> 00:35:01,945
Stop it.

668
00:35:11,746 --> 00:35:12,385
Don't worry.

669
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:17,665
She said

670
00:35:19,506 --> 00:35:20,865
I couldn't appear in her dreams.

671
00:35:42,986 --> 00:35:44,066
The person she likes

672
00:35:45,346 --> 00:35:46,066
is not me.

673
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:21,865
Your Highness.

674
00:36:22,185 --> 00:36:23,465
The weather is nice.

675
00:36:23,905 --> 00:36:24,945
How about archery practice?

676
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:26,266
I don't want to.

677
00:36:26,746 --> 00:36:27,826
How about making pills?

678
00:36:28,425 --> 00:36:29,586
His Majesty has sent rare herbs

679
00:36:29,586 --> 00:36:30,665
to you.

680
00:36:32,346 --> 00:36:32,945
Not interested.

681
00:36:33,586 --> 00:36:35,306
(Miao Pu, Shan Hu)
How about playing the zither?

682
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:36,705
Snacks?

683
00:36:37,385 --> 00:36:39,225
Or have a few drinks?

684
00:36:41,425 --> 00:36:42,266
Not interested.

685
00:36:57,026 --> 00:36:57,616
Xiaoyao.

686
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:00,826
What's wrong?

687
00:37:01,506 --> 00:37:02,905
You've been listless recently.

688
00:37:07,786 --> 00:37:08,368
Not at all.

689
00:37:08,945 --> 00:37:10,306
Everything is going well.

690
00:37:13,026 --> 00:37:14,066
How about you?

691
00:37:14,786 --> 00:37:15,385
Are you happy?

692
00:37:15,986 --> 00:37:16,506
Why?

693
00:37:17,266 --> 00:37:18,385
Why ask that all of a sudden?

694
00:37:20,586 --> 00:37:21,945
Miao Pu said

695
00:37:22,665 --> 00:37:24,705
you always sat late into the night.

696
00:37:25,066 --> 00:37:26,266
I thought you would get better

697
00:37:26,266 --> 00:37:27,145
after a while.

698
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:29,465
But you seem more and more upset.

699
00:37:30,546 --> 00:37:31,546
I'm very worried about you.

700
00:37:33,266 --> 00:37:34,826
Maybe it's because you're the King now,

701
00:37:34,905 --> 00:37:36,066
and I have no pressure.

702
00:37:36,705 --> 00:37:38,145
So my life

703
00:37:38,586 --> 00:37:39,986
is not as disciplined as before.

704
00:37:42,746 --> 00:37:43,705
Is that really so?

705
00:37:45,746 --> 00:37:47,026
Don't look at me like that.

706
00:37:51,705 --> 00:37:53,306
I thought that once I was enthroned,

707
00:37:55,026 --> 00:37:55,865
I could give you

708
00:37:55,865 --> 00:37:57,145
what I couldn't before

709
00:37:58,266 --> 00:37:59,786
and make your life better than before.

710
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,546
But you are not happy now.

711
00:38:03,905 --> 00:38:05,546
Did I do something wrong?

712
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:09,986
It's not your fault.

713
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:14,346
It's my problem.

714
00:38:14,986 --> 00:38:15,945
You tell me

715
00:38:17,746 --> 00:38:18,746
what goes wrong.

716
00:38:20,786 --> 00:38:22,185
Recently,

717
00:38:23,786 --> 00:38:26,106
I've been thinking about Qingshui Town

718
00:38:27,225 --> 00:38:28,665
and the days

719
00:38:29,506 --> 00:38:31,066
we spent in the Zhaoyun Hall.

720
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:33,905
I cherish those good times.

721
00:38:35,306 --> 00:38:36,625
But I don't like indulging

722
00:38:36,826 --> 00:38:38,385
in the past.

723
00:38:39,306 --> 00:38:40,705
Even if the past was beautiful,

724
00:38:41,665 --> 00:38:42,905
I have to move on.

725
00:38:43,786 --> 00:38:44,945
The past is the past.

726
00:38:46,106 --> 00:38:47,705
But I don't know what's wrong with me.

727
00:38:49,225 --> 00:38:50,066
I just

728
00:38:52,506 --> 00:38:54,905
always think of Shiqi.

729
00:38:57,346 --> 00:38:58,425
I don't know

730
00:38:58,425 --> 00:38:59,746
why I am so weak.

731
00:39:02,026 --> 00:39:03,665
I don't like who I am now.

732
00:39:06,266 --> 00:39:06,945
Xiaoyao.

733
00:39:09,746 --> 00:39:11,546
You are not alone now.

734
00:39:13,465 --> 00:39:15,306
I'm here for you. You can cry.

735
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:16,786
You can be weak.

736
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:18,346
It's okay.

737
00:39:20,705 --> 00:39:21,865
In the past,

738
00:39:22,945 --> 00:39:23,865
if I became weak

739
00:39:25,266 --> 00:39:26,826
when facing something,

740
00:39:27,346 --> 00:39:28,346
I would die.

741
00:39:29,546 --> 00:39:30,786
So, I told myself

742
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,026
I couldn't be weak.

743
00:39:34,346 --> 00:39:35,786
I just don't understand.

744
00:39:37,346 --> 00:39:38,625
I've gone through so much pain

745
00:39:38,705 --> 00:39:39,625
before.

746
00:39:41,185 --> 00:39:42,306
Why do I

747
00:39:43,905 --> 00:39:45,425
feel so heartbroken now?

748
00:39:46,945 --> 00:39:48,465
Just a man, right?

749
00:39:58,306 --> 00:39:59,225
Why do you

750
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:00,266
look even more upset than me?

751
00:40:01,986 --> 00:40:02,746
Don't worry.

752
00:40:03,385 --> 00:40:05,185
Time heals all wounds.

753
00:40:11,346 --> 00:40:12,945
Many years ago, I knew

754
00:40:14,865 --> 00:40:17,026
that emotional wounds are hard to heal.

755
00:40:19,425 --> 00:40:20,986
So, many years later,

756
00:40:21,026 --> 00:40:21,905
I can't forgive my mother

757
00:40:21,905 --> 00:40:23,586
for killing herself before my eyes.

758
00:40:25,385 --> 00:40:26,705
No matter how much I cried and begged,

759
00:40:28,586 --> 00:40:29,905
she still left me.

760
00:40:33,145 --> 00:40:34,905
Physical wounds can heal.

761
00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:36,586
I believe

762
00:40:37,225 --> 00:40:39,306
there must be a way
to heal emotional wounds as well.

763
00:40:40,986 --> 00:40:41,945
I believe it too.

764
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:46,145
It's just I can't forgive my mother.

765
00:40:48,066 --> 00:40:49,506
But now, with your companionship,

766
00:40:50,385 --> 00:40:51,945
the pain of losing her

767
00:40:52,586 --> 00:40:53,865
has long gone.

768
00:40:54,865 --> 00:40:55,986
The happiness now

769
00:40:56,786 --> 00:40:58,586
can heal past wounds.

770
00:40:59,786 --> 00:41:01,425
Are you encouraging me

771
00:41:01,786 --> 00:41:03,705
to start a new relationship?

772
00:41:08,106 --> 00:41:09,905
I hope someone

773
00:41:11,306 --> 00:41:11,986
can heal the pain

774
00:41:11,986 --> 00:41:13,986
Tushan Jing caused you.

775
00:41:15,786 --> 00:41:17,066
And someone else will make you

776
00:41:17,905 --> 00:41:18,705
feel valued,

777
00:41:19,546 --> 00:41:20,425
cherished,

778
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:21,945
and adored.

779
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:24,346
And no matter what,

780
00:41:24,905 --> 00:41:26,266
he will never abandon you.

781
00:41:30,546 --> 00:41:31,465
Well,

782
00:41:31,986 --> 00:41:34,266
I've been unlucky since childhood.

783
00:41:34,945 --> 00:41:36,346
I don't think

784
00:41:37,425 --> 00:41:38,705
I'll meet someone like that.

785
00:41:39,696 --> 00:41:40,306
You will.

786
00:41:49,145 --> 00:41:49,746
Xiaoyao.

787
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:52,944
You will.

788
00:42:00,705 --> 00:42:02,225
(If I had known)

789
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:03,945
(you would cry)

790
00:42:03,945 --> 00:42:06,066
(over Tushan Jing,)

791
00:42:06,986 --> 00:42:08,026
(even if I wanted the help)

792
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,465
(of the Tushan Family,)

793
00:42:09,665 --> 00:42:12,145
(I couldn't have given him the chance
to get close to you.)

794
00:42:14,145 --> 00:42:16,266
(Now I hate Tushan Jing.)

795
00:42:17,465 --> 00:42:19,746
(But I hate myself even more.)

796
00:42:43,338 --> 00:42:47,280
