1
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,439
Forget it. it's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit.

2
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,991
You always say that.
The same thing every time.

3
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,990
“I'm through, never again,
too dangerous.”

4
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,538
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.

5
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:44,034
You forget about it in a day or two.
The days of me forgetting are over.

6
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,209
The days of me remembering
have just begun.

7
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,483
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like?

8
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:51,499
I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
You sound like a duck.

9
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:55,094
Quack, quack, quack. Take heart, 'cause
you're never gonna have to hear it again.

10
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,593
Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're
never gonna have to hear me quack.

11
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:03,390
After tonight? Correct. I
got all tonight to quack.

12
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,355
Can I get anyone more coffee?
Oh, yes!

13
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,730
Thank you.
You're welcome.

14
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,904
I mean, the way it is now,

15
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,779
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

16
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,905
Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

17
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,988
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop
you in any way during a robbery.

18
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,292
They're insured. Why should they give a fuck?
I don't even need a gun in a federal bank.

19
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:29,837
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

20
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,881
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,

21
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:36,573
“We got this guy's little girl. if you don't
give him all your money, we're gonna kill her.”

22
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,437
- Did it work? - Fuckin' right it
worked. That's what I'm talkin' about.

23
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:45,265
Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone,
not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.

24
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:49,982
Cleans the place out. They don't lift a fuckin'
finger. Did they hurt the little girl?

25
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,777
There probably never was a little girl.
The point of the story isn't a little girl.

26
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:56,822
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

27
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,866
- You want to rob banks?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

28
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,432
I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be
easier than what we've been doing.

29
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:06,575
- No more liquor stores? - What've we been
talkin' about? Yeah, no more liquor stores.

30
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,731
Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.
There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.

31
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,733
Vietnamese, Koreans,
don't even speak fuckin' English.

32
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,152
You tell 'em empty out the register, they
don't know what you're talkin' about.

33
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,042
They make it too personal.

34
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:20,388
We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna
make us kill him. I'm not gonna kill anybody.

35
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:24,763
I don't want to either. But they'll probably
put us in a situation where it's us or them.

36
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,764
And if it's not the gooks,

37
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,542
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.

38
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:33,981
You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the
counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.

39
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,049
Try walkin' into one of those places
with nothing but a phone.

40
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,939
See how far that gets you.
Forget it.

41
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,942
We're out of it.
Well, what then, day jobs?

42
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,115
Not in this life.
Day jobs?

43
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,452
<i>Garcon, coffee'.!</i>

44
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,829
This place.

45
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,414
<i>Garcon means boy.</i>

46
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:00,298
This place?
<i>A</i> coffee shop?

47
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,347
What's wrong with that?

48
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,097
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not?

49
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,475
Bars, liquor stores,

50
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,274
gas stations; you get your head
blown off' stickin' up one of them.

51
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:18,025
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.

52
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:21,733
They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.

53
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:26,362
I bet you could cut down on the hero
factor in a place like this. Correct.

54
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,699
Same as banks,
these places are insured.

55
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,125
Manager.
He don't give a fuck.

56
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,052
They're just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin' the diners.

57
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:39,091
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way
they're takin' a bullet for the register.

58
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,090
Busboys. Some wetback gettin'
paid $1.50 an hour...

59
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,672
really give a fuck you're
stealin' from the owner?

60
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,912
Customers sittin' there with food in their
mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.

61
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:52,601
One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet, the
next, someone is stickin' a gun in their face.

62
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:57,731
See, I got the idea the last liquor
store we stuck up, remember?

63
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,483
- All the customers kept comin' in.
- Yeah.

64
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:04,408
You got the idea of ta kin' their wallets.
Now, that was a good idea.

65
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,828
- Thank you. - Made more from the
wallets than we did from the register.

66
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,243
Yes, we did. A lot of
people come to restaurants.

67
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,951
- A lot of wallets.
- Pretty smart, huh?

68
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,082
Pretty smart.

69
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,590
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

70
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:25,213
Come on. All right. Same
as last time, remember?

71
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,049
You're crowd control.
<i>I'll</i> handle the employees.

72
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,474
I love you, pumpkin.
I love you, honey bunny.

73
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,152
Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!

74
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:43,105
Any of you fucking pricks move,

75
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,909
and I'll execute every motherfuckin'
last one of you.

76
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:46,992
And I'll execute every motherfuckin'
last one of you.

Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars.
Okay, what you want to know?

88
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,466
Hash is legal there, right? Yeah,
it's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.

89
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:16,175
You just can't walk into a restaurant,
roll a joint and start puffin' away.

90
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,557
I mean, they want you to smoke in your
home or certain designated places.

91
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,306
Those are hash bars? Yeah.
It breaks down like this.

92
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,732
It's legal to buy it.
It's legal to own it.

93
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,982
And if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.

94
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:32,488
It's illegal to carry it, but-but that
doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this.

95
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:36,946
If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam,
it's illegal for them to search you.

96
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:40,996
I mean, that's a right the cops in
Amsterdam don? have. Oh, man! I'm goin'.

97
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,623
That's all there is to it.
I'm fuckin' goin'.

98
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,580
I know, baby.
You'd dig it the most.

99
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,424
But you know what the funniest
thing about Europe is? What?

100
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:53,425
It's the little differences. I mean, they got
the same shit over there that they got here,

101
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:57,053
- but its just there, it's a
little different. - Example.

102
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,261
You can walk into a movie theatre
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

103
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:03,973
And I don't mean just like no paper cup.
I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.

104
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:07,856
And in Paris, you can buy a beer in
McDonald's. You know what they call...

105
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,439
a Quarter Pounder
with Cheese in Paris?

106
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,695
They don't call it
a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?

107
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,639
They got the metric system. They wouldn't
know what the fuck a quarter-pounder is.

108
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,497
- What do they call it?
- They call it a Royale with Cheese.

109
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,081
Royale with Cheese.
That's right.

110
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,079
What do they call a Big Mac?

111
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,458
Big Mac's a Big Mac,
but they call it <i>Le</i> Big Mac.

112
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,632
<i>Le</i> Big Mac.

113
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,845
What do they call a Whopper? I don't know.
I didn't go into Burger King.

114
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,341
You know what they put on French fries
in Holland instead of ketchup? What?

115
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,434
Mayonnaise. Goddamn!

116
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:45,852
I seen'em do it, man. They fuckin'
drown 'em in that shit. Yuck.

117
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,816
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

118
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,534
How many up there?
Three or four.

119
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:01,200
That's countin' our guy?
Not sure.

120
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,700
So that means that it could be up to
five guys up there? It's possible.

121
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,126
We should have fuckin' shotguns.

122
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,838
What's her name?
Mia.

123
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:14,130
Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?
I don't know.

124
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,804
However people meet people.
She used to be a actress.

125
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,349
Oh, really? She do
anything I'd have seen?

126
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:24,846
I think her biggest deal was she starred
in a pilot. Pilot? What's a pilot?

127
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,474
Well, you know the shows on TV?
I don't watch TV.

128
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,152
Yeah, but you are aware that there
is an invention called television,

129
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,363
and on this invention they
show shows, right? Yeah.

130
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,819
The way they pick TV shows is they make
one show. That show's called a pilot.

131
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,826
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

132
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,895
and on the strength of that one show, they
decide if they wanna make more shows.

133
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,459
Some get chosen and become television
programs. Some don't, become nothin'.

134
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,711
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

135
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,544
You remember Antwan Rockamora?

136
00:09:56,638 --> 00:10:00,427
Half-black, half-Samoan.
Used to call him “Tony Rocky Horror.”

137
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,926
Yeah, maybe. Fat, right? I wouldn't
go so far as to call the brother fat.

138
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,820
He got a weight problem. I mean,
what's a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.

139
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:11,313
I think I know who you mean. What about
him? Marsellus fucked him up good.

140
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:15,646
Word 'round the camp fire is it was on
account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.

141
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,784
So what he'd do? Fuck her? No, no,
no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.

142
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,583
Well, then what then?
He gave her a foot massage.

143
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,049
A foot massage?

144
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,214
That's it?
Mm-hmm.

145
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,215
Then what'd Marsellus do?

146
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,469
Sent a couple cats over to his place.
They took him out on his patio.

147
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,474
Threw his ass over the balcony.
Nigger fell four stories.

148
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:51,603
He had a little garden down at the bottom
enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.

149
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,934
Nigger fell <i>through</i> that.

150
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,941
Since then, he kind of developed
a speech impediment.

151
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,157
That's a damn shame.
Hmm.

152
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:09,663
But still, you play with matches,
you get burned. What do you mean?

153
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:13,871
You don't be givin' Marsellus
Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

154
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,423
You don't think he overreacted?

155
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:21,379
Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the
way he did, but he had to expect a reaction.

156
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:25,591
It was a foot massage. A foot massage is
nothin'. I give my mother a foot massage.

157
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,223
It's laying your hands in a familiar
way on Marsellus's new wife.

158
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:34,184
I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy
out? No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.

159
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,359
Whoa, stop right there.
Eatin' the bitch out...

160
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,091
and givin' the bitch a foot massage
ain't even the same fucking thing.

161
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:43,029
It's not. It's the same ballpark.
Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.

162
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,032
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine.

163
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,865
But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking
your tongue in the holiest of holies...

164
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,169
ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the
same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport.

165
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:58,131
Foot massages don't mean shit! Have
you ever given a foot massage?

166
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,256
Don't be tellin'
me about foot massages.

167
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,049
I'm the foot fuckin' master.
You given a lot of them?

168
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,350
Shit, yeah! Got my technique down and
everything. I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.

169
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,098
Would you give a guy
a foot massage?

170
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,140
Fuck you.

171
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,314
You give 'em a lot?
Fuck you.

172
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,689
You know, I'm kind of tired. I could
use a foot massage. Yo, yo, yo, man.

173
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,992
You best back off.
I'm gettin' a little pissed here.

174
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,620
This is the door.
Yeah, it is.

175
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,993
What time you got?

176
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,203
7:22 in the a.m.

177
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,881
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

178
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:51,176
Now, look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no
man a foot massage don't make it right...

179
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,480
for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a
building into a glass motherfuckin' house,

180
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,273
fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks; that shit ain't right.

181
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,570
Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better
paralyse my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker.

182
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:06,617
I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin' a foot
massage don't mean nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.

183
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:11,322
Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million
foot massages, and they all meant somethin'.

184
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:15,125
We act like they don't, but they do.
That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.

185
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,293
There's a sensuous thing goin' on...

186
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,589
where you don't talk about it,
but you know it and she knows it.

187
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:25,715
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan
should've fuckin' better known better.

188
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:30,174
That's his fuckin' wife, man. This ain't a
man with a sense of humour about this shit.

189
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:33,056
You know what I'm sayin'?

190
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,057
It's an interestin' point.

191
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,105
Come on.
Let's get into character.

192
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,989
What's her name again?
Mia.

193
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:49,109
Mia. Why you so interested
in big man's wife?

194
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:54,369
He's goin' out of town, Florida. And he asked
me if I'd take care of her while he's gone.

195
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,459
Take care of her? No, man.
Just take her out.

196
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,880
Show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.

197
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,503
You're gonna be takin'
Mia Wallace out on a date?

198
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,211
It is not a date.

199
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:11,344
It's just like if you were gonna take your
buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.

200
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,969
It's just good company, that's all.

201
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:23,443
It's not a date. It's
definitely not a date.

202
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,486
It's not a date. It's
definitely not a date.

203
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,995
Hey, kids.
How you boys doin'?

204
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,744
Hey, keep chillin'.

205
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,712
You know who we are?

206
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:49,761
We're associates of your business
partner, Marsellus Wallace.

207
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,839
You do remember
your business partner, don't you?

208
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,519
Now, let me take
a wild guess here.

209
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,563
- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.

210
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:07,897
I thought so. You remember your
business partner Marsellus Wallace,

211
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,616
don't ya, Brett?
Yeah, I remember.

212
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,991
Good. Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

213
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,699
Sorry about that.
Whatcha havin'?

214
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,750
Hamburgers.

215
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:24,922
Hamburgers! The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.

216
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,541
What kind of hamburgers?

217
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,385
Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.
No, no, no.

218
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,509
Where'd you get 'em? McDonald's,
Wendy's, jack in the Box?

219
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,429
Where?
Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.

220
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,637
Big Kahuna Burger! That's
that Hawaiian burger joint.

221
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,644
I hear they got some tasty burgers. I
ain't never had one myself. How are they?

222
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,396
They're-They're good.

223
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,104
You mind if I try one of yours?

224
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,610
This is yours here, right?
Yeah.

225
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,708
Mmmm.

226
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,912
This is a tasty burger!
Vincent!

227
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,543
You ever had
a Big Kahuna burger?

228
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,009
Want a bite?
They're real tasty.

229
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,550
I ain't hungry. Well, if you like
burgers, give 'em a try sometime.

230
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,474
Me, I can't usually get 'em
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,

231
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,679
which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian.

232
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,890
But I do love the taste
of a good burger. Mmmm.

233
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:29,478
You know what they call a Quarter
Pounder with Cheese in France?

234
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,605
No.
Tell 'em, Vincent.

235
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:35,735
A Royale with Cheese.
A Royale with Cheese.

236
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,287
You know why they call it that?

237
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,456
Uh, because of
the metric system?

238
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,791
Check out the big brain
on Brett!

239
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,249
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.

240
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,669
What's in this?
Sprite.

241
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,675
Sprite. Good.

242
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,600
You mind if I have some of your tasty
beverage to wash this down with?

243
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,599
Go right ahead.

244
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,825
That hit the spot.

245
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:21,906
You. Flock of Seagulls.
You know why we're here?

246
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,579
Why don't you tell my man Vince here where
you got the shit hid at. It's over-

247
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,288
I don't remember askin' you
a goddamned thing!

248
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,756
You were sayin'?

249
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,882
It's in the cupboard.

250
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:42,642
N-No, the one
by your kn-knees.

251
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,782
We happy?

252
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,743
Vincent?

253
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,500
- We happy?
- Yeah, we happy.

254
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:17,882
Look, I'm sorry, uh,
I-I didn't get your name.

255
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:21,090
I got yours. Vincent. Right?
B-But I never got yours.

256
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:26,561
My name's Pitt, and your ass ain't talkin'
your way outta this shit. No, no, no.

257
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,978
I just want you
to know how-

258
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:37,106
I just want you to know how sorry we
are Th-that things got so fucked up...

259
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,361
with us
and Mr. Wallace.

260
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:43,946
W-We got into this thing with the
best intentions. Really. I never-

261
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,374
Oh, I'm sorry, did I break
your concentration?

262
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,084
I didn't mean to do that.
Please.

263
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:55,382
Continue. You were saying something
about “best intentions.”

264
00:18:56,761 --> 00:19:00,629
What's the matter?
Oh, you were finished!

265
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,431
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

266
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,971
What does Marsellus Wallace
look like?

267
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,228
What?

268
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,527
What country you from?
What?

269
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:19,865
“What” ain't no country I ever heard of.
They speak English in What? W-What?

270
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,654
English, Motherfucker!
Do you speak it? Yes!

271
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,448
Then you know what I'm sayin'!
Yes.

272
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,951
Describe what
Marsellus Wallace looks like!

273
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,659
What? I-
Say “what” again!

274
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:34,621
Say “what” again! I dare ya!
I double dare you, motherfucker!

275
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:38,625
Say “what” one more goddamn time!
H-H-He's black.

276
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,051
- Go on!
- He's bald!

277
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,800
- Does he look like a bitch?
- What?

278
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,560
Does he look...
like a bitch?

279
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,852
No! Then why you tryin' to
fuck him like a bitch, Brett?

280
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:56,567
I didn't. Yes, you did.
Yes, you did, Brett!

281
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,858
You tried to fuck him.
No, no.

282
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:04,193
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

283
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,324
You read the Bible, Brett?
Yes!

284
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:11,955
Well, there's this passage I got memorized.
Sort of fits this occasion.

285
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,376
Ezekiel 25:17.

286
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,751
“The path of the righteous man...

287
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:21,756
“is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish...

288
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,759
“and the tyranny of evil men.

289
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:29,764
“Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and goodwill,

290
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,972
“shepherds the weak

00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,727

when all this shit
is over and done-

I think you're gonna find yourself
one smilin' motherfucker.

304
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,409
The thing is, Butch,

305
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,537
right now...
you got ability.

306
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,624
But painful as it may be,

307
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,877
ability... don't last.

And your days

Now, that's a hard
motherfuckin' fact of life.

310
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:57,518
But that's a fact of life your ass is
gonna have to get realistic about.

311
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:04,859
You see, this business is filled to the
brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

312
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:08,943
Motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine.

313
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:14,364
If you mean it turns
to vinegar... it does.

If you mean it gets better
with age... it don't.

315
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,506
Besides, Butch,

316
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:28,879
how many fights you think
you got in you anyway?

317
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,135
Hmm?

318
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,182
Two?

319
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,679
Boxers don't have
an old-timers' day.

320
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:42,775
You came close,
but you never made it.

321
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:47,072
And if you were gonna make it,
you would have made it before now.

322
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:50,366
<i>♪♪</i>

323
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,040
You my nigger?

324
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,135
Certainly appears so.

325
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:23,524
The night of the fight,
you may feel a slight sting.

326
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,023
That's pride fuckin' with you.

327
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,693
Fuck pride!

328
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,452
Pride only hurts.

329
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,453
It never helps.

330
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,916
You fight through that shit.

331
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:50,294
'Cause a year from now,
when you kickin' it in the Caribbean,

332
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:55,302
you gonna say to yourself,
“Marsellus Wallace was right.”

333
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:01,638
I got no problem
with that, Mr. Wallace.

334
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:05,521
In the fifth,
your ass goes down.

335
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,530
Say it.

336
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:17,245
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

337
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,658
Yo, Vincent Vega.
Our man in Amsterdam.

338
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:26,167
Jules Winfield, our man in Inglewood.
Get your asses on in here.

339
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:30,132
Goddamn, nigger, what's up with them
clothes? You don't even want to know.

340
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:33,462
Where's the big man?

341
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,468
The big man's right over there
takin' care of some business.

342
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:41,018
Why don't you hang back a second or two. You
see the white boy leave, just go on over.

343
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,939
How ya been?

344
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:49,982
I been doin' pretty good. How
'bout yourself? All right.

345
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,448
So I hear you're
takin' Mia out tomorrow.

346
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,783
At Marsellus's request.

347
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,575
Have you met Mia?
Not yet.

348
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,829
What's so fuckin' funny?

349
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,547
Not a goddamn thing.
I got to piss.

350
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:13,877
Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot, all right?
It's the big man's wife.

351
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,633
I'm gonna sit across from her,
chew my food with my mouth closed,

352
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,681
laugh at her fuckin' jokes,
and that's it.

353
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,885
Hey, my name's Paul,
and this shit's between y'all.

354
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:25,017
Then what'd you fuckin'
ask me about it for?

355
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,599
Asshole.

356
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,031
Gimme a pack of Red Apples.
Filters?

357
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,029
No.

358
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:44,787
You lookin' at somethin', friend?
You ain't my friend, palooka.

359
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:50,372
What was that? I think you
heard me just fine, punchy.

360
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,049
Vincent Vega's in the house?

361
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:56,423
My nigger,
get your ass over here.

362
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,763
What's up? Man,
I'm really sorry.

363
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,019
You shouldn't worry about it.

364
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,067
Pack of Red Apples.
$1.40.

365
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,905
And some matches.

366
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,948
Thanks.

367
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:28,121
It's as if it turns every part
of your body into the tip of a penis.

368
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:32,126
- Whoa. - I'll lend it to you.
It's a great book on piercing.

369
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:36,585
That gun to pierce your ears, they don't
use that to pierce your nipples, do they?

370
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:40,512
Forget that gun. That guns goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.

371
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:45,469
All my piercing, 18 places on my body,
every one of' em done with a needle.

372
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:49,021
Five in each ear, one through
the nipple of my left breast,

373
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:52,226
two in my right nostril,
one in my left eyebrow,

374
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,152
one in my belly, one in my lip,
one in my clit,

375
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:58,698
- and I wear a stud in my tongue.
- Excuse me.

376
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,695
I was just curious,

377
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:04,654
but, urn... why would you
wear a stud in your tongue?

378
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:08,207
Sex thing.
Helps fellatio.

379
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:12,252
Vincenzo.
Step in my office.

380
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:22,092
This is Panda from Mexico.
Very good stuff.

381
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:25,595
Now, that's Bava.
Different, but equally good.

382
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:28,599
And that is Choco from the
Harz Mountains of Germany.

383
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:33,104
Now, the first two are the same. 300
a gram. Those are friend prices.

384
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:36,151
But this one is
a little more expensive.

385
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,605
This is 500 a gram.

386
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:42,067
But, when you shoot it, you will
know where that extra money went.

387
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:46,246
There's nothing wrong with these two.
This is real, real, real good shit.

388
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,995
But this one
is a fuckin' madman.

389
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,827
Remember, I just got back
from Amsterdam.

390
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,913
Am I a nigger?
Are we in Inglewood? No.

391
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:59,171
You're in my home. Now, white
people who know the difference...

392
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:02,219
between good shit and bad shit,
this is the house they come to.

393
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:05,640
Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi
Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...

394
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,055
any old day of the fuckin' week.
That's a bold statement.

395
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:12,980
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.
This is a seller's market.

396
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:17,060
Coke is fuckin' dead
as... dead.

397
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:20,988
Heroin, it's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way.

398
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:25,743
All right. Gimme three
grams of madman. Okay.

399
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:29,242
Now, if it's as good as you say it is,
I'll come back and buy another thousand.

400
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,075
I just hope that I still
have some left for ya,

401
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:36,333
but I'm givin' you some out
of my own private stash.

402
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,541
That is what a nice guy I am.

403
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:43,761
I'm outta balloons. ls a baggie all right?
Yeah, that's cool.

404
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,804
All right.
<i>I'll</i> just get one for ya.

405
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:50,806
Honey, will you get me some baggies
and, uh, twistix from the kitchen?

406
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,853
Okay.

407
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,399
Hey, uh, what do you think about Trudi?
She ain't got a boyfriend.

408
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,769
You wanna hang out and get high?
Which one's Trudi?

409
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:04,069
The one with all the shit in her face?
No, that's Jody.

410
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,526
That's my wife.

411
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:11,202
I'm sorry, man.
Thank you.

412
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:15,167
No, I can't. I gotta be someplace.
All right, no <i>problemo.</i>

413
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,962
I'll take a rain check.

414
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:21,382
Oh.
Thank you, Jody.

415
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,756
Still got your Malibu?

416
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,884
Oh, man, you know what some
fucker did the other day?

417
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,882
What?
Fuckin' keyed it.

418
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,602
Oh, man, that's fucked up.
Tell me about it.

419
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:36,351
I had it in storage
for three years.

420
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:40,776
It was out five days, and some
dickless piece of shit fucked with it.

421
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:45,277
They should be fuckin' killed, man.
No trial, no jury, straight to execution.

422
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:50,032
I wish I could've caught him doin' it. I'd
have given anything to catch that asshole.

423
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:54,873
It'd been worth him doin' it just so I
could've caught him. What a fucker!

424
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,702
What's more chicken-shit than
fuckin' with a man's automobile?

425
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:00,671
Don't fuck with another man's vehicle.
You don't do it.

426
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,630
It's just against the rules.
Thank you.

427
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,169

They certainly do.

641
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:30,134
- Don't be shy, Vincent. What else
did “they” say? - I'm-I'm not shy.

642
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,765
<i>- Um-
- Did it involve the “F” word?</i>

643
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:36,849
No, no, no, no, no. They just said that
Antwan had given you a foot massage.

644
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:40,978
- And?
- And-And nothin'.

645
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,939
That's it.

646
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:46,070
You heard Marsellus...

647
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,449
threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourth-story
window for giving me a foot massage?

648
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,492
Mm-hmm.
And you believe that?

649
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:57,123
Well, at the time I
was told it sounded reasonable.

650
00:45:57,213 --> 00:46:00,296
Marsellus throwing Tony out
of a fourth-story window...

651
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:03,421
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

652
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:06,970
No, it seemed excessive,
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

653
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:09,673
I understand that Marsellus
is very protective of you.

654
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:14,386
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

655
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,189
A husband almost killing another man for
touching his wife's feet is something else.

656
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,813
But did it happen?

657
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:26,782
Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was
my hand when he shook it... at my wedding.

658
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:29,234
Really?

659
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:32,662
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus
threw Tony out that window...

660
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,659
except Marsellus and Tony.

661
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,709
When you little scamps get together,
you're worse than a sewing circle.

662
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:42,710
Ladies and gentlemen. Now the
moment you've all been waiting for.

663
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,840
The world-famous
Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.

664
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:54,555
Now, this is where
one lucky couple...

665
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:59,105
will win this handsome trophy
that Marilyn here is holding.

666
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,729
Now, who will be
our first contestants?

667
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,107
- Right here!
- All right!

668
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:08,189
- I wanna dance.
- No, no, no, no, no.

669
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:12,994
No, no, no, no, no. I do believe
Marsellus, my husband, your boss,

670
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,493
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

671
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:20,248
Now I wanna dance; I wanna
win; I want that trophy.

672
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,921
- So dance good.
- All right. You asked for it.

673
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:23,621
Let's hear it for
our first contestants.

674
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,964
Let's hear it for
our first contestants.

675
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:35,843
Now let's meet our first contestants here
this evening. Young lady, what is your name?

676
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,893
Mrs. Mia Wallace.

677
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,597
And how 'bout your fella here?

678
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,523
Vincent Vega.

679
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,978
All right, let's see what
you can do. Take it away!

680
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:49,026
- Go for it.

assholes never to call here this late!

<i>Don't

00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,564
Lance! Vincent.

773
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:08,521
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.
I'm coming to your house.

774
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:12,700
W-Whoa. Whoa. Hold your horses, man.
W-What's the problem?

775
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:16,029
- I got this chick, she's fuckin' O.D.in'
on me! - Well, don't bring her here!

776
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:20,458
I'm not even joking with you! Do not be
bringing some fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!

777
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:22,581
- No choice.
- Wh-She's O.D.in'?

778
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:25,880
- She's <i>fuckin' dyin' on me, man!
- Just dandy.</i>

779
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:30,130
Okay, then you bite the fuckin' bullet,
take her to a hospital and call a lawyer.

780
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,632
- Negative!
- This is not my fuckin' problem, man!

781
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:36,432
You fucked her up,
you fuckin' deal with this!

782
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:39,351
Uh, are you talkin' to me
on a cellular phone?

783
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:41,850
I don't know you. Who is this?
Don't come here!

784
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,274
I'm hanging up the phone!
Prank caller! Prank caller!

785
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:56,281
What the hell was that?

786
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,615
Have you lost your fucking mind?

787
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:03,618
You were talking about drug shit on
a cellular phone! Lance, help me.

788
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:06,667
You crashed your car into my fucking house!
Grab her feet.

789
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:10,170
Are you deaf? You are not bringing
this fucked-up bitch into my house!

790
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,127
This “fucked-up bitch” is
Marsellus Wallace's wife.

791
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,675
Do you know who Marsellus
Wallace is? Yeah.

792
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:18,679
If she croaks on me,
I am a fucking grease spot!

793
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:23,354
I will be forced to tell him that you did
not help and let her die on your lawn.

794
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,398
Now, come on, help me, help me.
Pick her up.

795
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,401
Shit.

796
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,815

797
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:35,820

798
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:38,323

Go to the fridge and get the thing
with the adrenaline shot.

802
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:48,788
What's wrong with her?
She's O.D.ing!

803
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:50,961
- Get her outta here!
- Get the shot!

804
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:54,586
Fuck you! Fuck you too!
What a fuckin' bitch.

805
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,591
Just keep talking
to her, all right?

806
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:59,595
She's gettin' the shot. I'm going to
go get my little black medical book.

807
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,676
What the fuck you need
a medical book for?

808
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:03,690
I've never had to give
an adrenaline shot before!

809
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:07,140
I don't go joy-poppin' with bubble-gummers!
My friends can handle their highs!

810
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,642
Get the shot!
I am, if you'll let me!

811
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:12,645
I ain't stopping you! Stop talking to me.
Start talking to her!

812
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:14,692
Get the shot!
All right!

813
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:21,282
Hurry up. We're losing her!
I'm looking as fast as I can!

814
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:23,239
What's he looking for?

815
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:26,242
- I don't know. Some book.
- What are you looking for?

816
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:29,291
A little black medical book.
What are you looking for?

817
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:33,420
My little black medical book! It's
like a textbook they give to nurses.

818
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:36,419
I never saw no medical book.
Trust me. I have one.

819
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:39,422
If it's so important, why don't you
keep it with the shot? I don't know!

820
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:43,472
Stop bothering me! While you're looking,
that girl's gonna die on our carpet.

821
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:45,428
You're never gonna find
anything in this mess!

822
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:49,398
I'm gonna fucking kill you if you
don't shut up! Lance, get in here!

823
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:53,690
Right? Pig. Get the
fuck outta my way.

824
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:57,235
Quit fuckin' around and give her the shot.
While I'm doing this,

825
00:58:57,325 --> 00:59:00,613
you take off her shirt
and find her heart.

826
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:04,284
- Does it gotta be exact? - We're giving her
a shot in the heart, so it's gotta be exact.

827
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,241
I don't know exactly where
her heart is. I think it's right here.

828
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:11,041
That's it. All right, what I
need is a big, fat magic marker.

829
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,042
You got it?
What?

830
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:15,795
A magic marker.
A felt pen!

831
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:18,469
A fuckin' black magic marker!
Christ.

832
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:23,683
Come on, man. Hurry up! Fuck! Okay, okay.
Okay. I think it's ready.

833
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:29,267
- Hurry up, man.
- I'll tell you what to do.

834
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:32,266
You're gonna give her the shot. No,
you're gonna give her the shot.

835
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,381
I ain't giving her the shot. I never done
this before. I never clone this either!

836
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,397
I ain't starting now! You brought her here.
You give her the shot.

837
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:41,860
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch to
your house, then I give her the shot.

838
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,864
Give it to me.
Give me that.

839
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:46,868
All right, tell me what to do.

840
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:49,871
Okay, you're giving her an injection
of adrenaline straight to her heart.

841
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,916
But she's got a breastplate-you gotta
pierce through that.

842
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,919
You gotta bring the needle
down in a stabbing motion.

843
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:59,464
I gotta-I gotta stab her three times?
No, just stab her once!

844
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:02,967
But it's gotta be hard enough to get
through her breastplate into her heart.

845
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:05,925
Once you do that, you p-press
down on the p-plunger.

846
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:08,519
Okay. Then what happens? Kinda
curious about that myself.

847
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,472
This ain't no fuckin' joke!
Am I gonna kill her?

848
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,976
She's supposed to come out of it like that.
It's-All right, count to three.

849
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:17,274
All right. Ready?
One.

850
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,113
Two.

851
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:34,044
Three!

852
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,888
If you're all right,
then say something.

853
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:54,974
Something.

854
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,025
That was fuckin' trippy.

855
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:02,948
Ohh.
Oh, man.

856
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,553
Mia. Mia.

857
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,142
What's-

858
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:37,020
What's your thoughts
on-on-

859
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,101
on how to handle this?

860
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:41,153
What's yours?

861
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:48,069
Well, I'm of the opinion that if
Marsellus lived his whole life,

862
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:52,077
he doesn't need to know
nothing about this incident.

863
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:55,080
If Marsellus knew
about this incident,

864
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,207
I'd be in as much trouble as you.

865
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:59,789
I seriously doubt that.

866
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:02,796
I can keep a secret if you can.

867
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,757
Shake on it?

868
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,265
Mum's the word?

869
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:16,267
Cool.

870
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:20,693
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going
to go home and have a heart attack.

871
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,363
Vincent.

872
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:30,236
<i>Do you</i> wanna hear
<i>my Fox Force Five</i> joke?

873
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:33,242
Sure.

874
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:36,325
Except I think I'm still
a little too petrified to laugh.

875
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,332
No, you won't laugh
'cause it's not funny.

876
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:42,710
But if you still wanna hear it,
<i>I'll</i> tell it.

877
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:45,049
I can't wait.
Okay.

878
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:47,969
Three tomatoes are
walkin' down the street.

879
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:50,468
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato
and Baby Tomato.

880
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:54,677
Baby Tomato starts lagging behind,
and Papa Tomato gets really angry.

881
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,684
Goes back and squishes him
and says,

882
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,890
“Ketchup.”

883
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,648
Ketchup.

884
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,901
See you around.

885
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:35,684
<i>Oh, that paddlefoot.
He funny, silly dog.</i>

886
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:38,683
<i>He think totem pole alive!</i>

887
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:41,481
<i>He Arctic tenderfoot!</i>

888
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:45,152
<i>That totem pole
been here forever!</i>

889
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,237
Butch?

890
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:50,157
<i>One more thing, and we'll start for-</i>

891
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:53,110
- Butch, stop watching TV for a second.
- Yeah?

892
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:56,864
- You've got a special visitor.
<i>- <i>Stand</i> up. <i>Stand</i> up.

893
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:04,539
Now, do you remember when I told you
your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp?

894
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:08,375
Well, this here is Captain Koons.

895
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:11,383
He was in the P.O.W. camp
with Daddy.

896
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:18,639
Hello, little man.

897
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:22,815
Boy, I sure heard
a bunch about you.

898
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:26,110
See, I was a good friend
of your dad's.

899
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:29,234
We were in that Hanoi
pit of hell together...

900
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:31,736
over five years.

901
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,737
Hopefully...

902
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,741
you'll never have to
experience this yourself,

903
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:40,244
but when two men are in a situation
like me and your dad were...

904
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:43,123
for as long as we were,

905
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:47,502
you take on certain
responsibilities of the other.

906
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,503
If it'd been me who'd-

907
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:52,756
not made it,

908
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:57,136
Major Coolidge'd be talking
right now to my son Jim.

909
01:04:57,227 --> 01:05:00,845
But the way it turned out,
I'm talking to you.

910
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,184
Butch...

911
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:07,688
I got something for ya.

912
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:16,284
This watch I got here...

913
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:21,116
was first purchased by your great-grandfather
during the First World War.

914
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:25,874
It was bought in a little general
store in Knoxville, Tennessee.

915
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:29,502
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

916
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:32,505
Up 'til then, people just
carried pocket watches.

917
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:35,758
It was bought by Private
Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

918
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:38,762
on the day he set sail
for Paris.

919
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:41,264
This was your
great-grandfathers war watch,

920
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,688
and he wore it every day
he was in that war, and...

921
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:48,312
when he'd clone his duty, he went
home to your great-grandmother,

922
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:52,818
took the watch off, put it in an old
coffee can, and in that can it stayed...

923
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:57,322
until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,
was called upon by his country...

924
01:05:57,412 --> 01:06:01,121
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

925
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:04,666
This time they called it
World War II.

926
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:09,713
Your great-grandfather gave this watch
to your granddad for good luck.

927
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,791
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't
as good as his old man's.

928
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:15,799
Dane was a Marine,
and he was killed,

929
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:19,883
along with all the other Marines
at the battle of Wake Island.

930
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,889
Your granddad was facing death.

931
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,890
He knew it.

932
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:28,895
None of those boys had any illusions
about ever leaving that island alive,

933
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:32,194
so three days before
the Japanese took the island,

934
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:37,491
your granddad asked a gunner on an Air
Force transport, name of Winocki-

935
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:40,490
a man he'd never met before
in his life-

936
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,538
to deliver to his infant son,

937
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:48,210
who he'd never seen in the flesh,
his gold watch.

938
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:52,631
Three days later, your granddad was
dead, but Winocki kept his word.

939
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:56,927
After the war was over,
he paid a visit to your grandmother,

940
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:01,257
delivering to your infant father
his dad's gold watch.

941
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:03,262
This watch.

942
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:14,566
This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.

943
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:18,069
He was captured, put in
a Vietnamese prison camp.

944
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:22,198
He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch,

945
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:25,781
it'd be confiscated, taken away.

946
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:29,584
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

947
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:33,585
He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their
greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright,

948
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:37,589
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something-his ass.

949
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:41,092
Five long years
he wore this watch up his ass.

950
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:45,346
Then he died of dysentery-
He give me the watch.

951
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:49,270
I hid this uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass two years.

952
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:51,268
Then“.

953
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:55,444
After seven years,
I was sent home to my family and...

954
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:57,441
HOW...

955
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:02,825
little man,
I give the watch to you.

956
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,596
It's time, Butch.

957
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:38,228
<i>In the lightweight division,</i>

958
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:41,482
<i>in the right corn er wearing
the blue trunks,</i>

959
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:44,819
<i>weighing 210 pounds,</i>

960
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:48,030
<i>Floyd Ray Wilson!</i>

961
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,993
<i>It's official. It's official.</i>

962
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:56,042
<i>Wilson is dead! Well,
Dan, that had to be the bloodiest...</i>

963
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,544
<i>hands down, the most brutal fight
this city's ever seen.</i>

964
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:02,253
<i>Coolidge was out of there tester than I've
ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring.</i>

965
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:05,214
<i>Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?
My guess would be yes.</i>

966
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:08,721
<i>I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way
to the realization of what he was doing.</i>

967
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:12,224
<i>I think any man would've left the ring
that fast. Do you feel this tragedy...</i>

968
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:14,226
<i>is gonna affect
the world of boxing?</i>

969
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:18,231
<i>A tragedy like this can't help but shake the
world of boxing to its very foundations.</i>

970
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:22,280
<i>It's of paramount importance, during the sad
weeks ahead, the eyes of the W.B.A. remain-</i>

971
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:59,397
Man, you know
I didn't-

972
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:02,400
Marsellus. No, it wasn't.
I didn't do it.

973
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,401
I didn't do it.

974
01:10:04,492 --> 01:10:06,984
How you doing?
Great.

975
01:10:07,078 --> 01:10:09,490
I never thanked you for dinner.

976
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:13,282
What you got?
He booked.

977
01:10:13,418 --> 01:10:16,456
His trainer? Says he don't know nothin'.
I believe him.

978
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:20,000
I think Butch surprised his ass same as us.
No, we don't wanna “think.”

979
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:23,675
We wanna know. Take him to the
kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.

980
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:27,174
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

981
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:29,176
Butch's search-
how do you want it done?

982
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:32,180
I'm prepared to scour the Earth
for that motherfucker.

983
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:35,638
If Butch goes to Indochina, I want a
nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...

984
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:40,017
ready to pop a cap in his ass.
I will take care of it.

985
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:52,238
Mister.

986
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:57,626
Hey, mister.
What?

987
01:10:57,712 --> 01:11:02,457
You were in that fight,
the fight on the radio.

988
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:06,051
You're the fighter?
Whatever gave you that idea?

989
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:08,845
No, come on.

990
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,888
You're him.

991
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:13,387
I know you're him.

992
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:17,012
Tell me you're him.

993
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,017
I'm him.

994
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:22,567
You killed the other boxing man.

995
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:28,281
He's dead?

996
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:30,779
The radio said he was dead.

997
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:35,788
Sorry about that, Floyd.

998
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:39,576
What does it feel like?

999
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:41,581
What does what feel like?

1000
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,583
Killing a man.

1001
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:49,423
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

1002
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:51,425
What are you, a weirdo?

1003
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:53,427
No.

1004
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:58,433
It is a subject I have
much interest in.

1005
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:02,437
You are the first person I have
ever met who has killed somebody.

1006
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:07,313
SQ?

1007
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:10,736
What does it feel like to kill a man?

1008
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:13,739
<i>I'll</i> tell you what.

1009
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:17,789
Give me one of them cigarettes you got
up there and I'll tell you all about it.

1010
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:38,719
So, Esmarelda...

1011
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:43,432
Villa Lobos-
is that Mexican?

1012
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:46,735
The name is Spanish,
but I am Colombian.

1013
01:12:46,821 --> 01:12:50,064
- That's some handle you got there, honey.
- Thank you.

1014
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:52,114
And what is your name?

1015
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,862
Butch.

1016
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:56,411
Butch.

1017
01:12:56,497 --> 01:13:01,242
- What does it mean? - I'm an American,
honey. Our names don't mean shit.

1018
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:03,952
So, moving right along,

1019
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,957
Esmarelda,

1020
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:08,289
what is it you want to know?

1021
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:13,296
I want to know what it feels like
to kill a man. I couldn't tell ya.

1022
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:23,601
I didn't know he was dead
'til you told me he was dead.

1023
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:28,276
Now that I know he's dead,
you wanna know how I feel about it?

1024
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:35,446
I don't feel
the least bit bad about it.

1025
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:48,831
What the fuck'd I tell ya?
Huh?

1026
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:52,839
As soon as the word got out the fix was
in, man, the odds went through the roof.

1027
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:55,136
I know. I know.
Unbelievable.

1028
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:58,635
Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was a
better boxer, he'd still be alive.

1029
01:13:58,726 --> 01:14:00,637
If he never laced up his gloves,

1030
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:03,728
which he never shoulda done in the first
fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.

1031
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:08,816
Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?
It's over now.

1032
01:14:08,903 --> 01:14:11,816
Yeah, well, enough about the
poor, unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1033
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:15,570
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1034
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:18,573
How many bookies did you
lay it around on?

1035
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:21,075
All eight?
How long to collect?

1036
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:25,663
So you'll have it all by tomorrow night?
No, I understand.

1037
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:28,871
A few stragglers aside.
Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.

1038
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:31,172
That is great news, man.

1039
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:35,468
Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1040
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:38,797
It'll probably take us a couple
clays to get down to Knoxville.

1041
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:40,802
Okay, my brother.

1042
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:42,850
You're right.

1043
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:45,224
You're goddamn right.

1044
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:48,807
All right, Scotty, next time I see
you, it'll be on Tennessee time.

1045
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:51,108
Cool, brother.

1046
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:52,112
Cool, brother.

1047
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,831
$45.60.

1048
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:14,336
And, uh.

1049
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:17,670
Here's a little something
for the effort. Now...

1050
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:21,722
if anybody asks you who your fare was
tonight, what are you gonna say?

1051
01:15:21,809 --> 01:15:23,720
The truth.

1052
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:27,304
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1053
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:31,558
Bonsoir, Esmarelda Villa Lobos.

1054
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:34,189
<i>Buenas noches, Butch.</i>

1055
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:47,198
Whew.

1056
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:50,584
Keep the light off.

1057
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:53,584
Is that better, sugar pop?
Oui.

1058
01:15:58,095 --> 01:16:00,006
Hard day at the office?

1059
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:02,008
Pretty hard.

1060
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:04,306
Got in a fight.

1061
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:06,555
Poor baby.

1062
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:09,182
Can you make spoons?

1063
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:12,140
You know what? I was thinkin'
about takin' a shower.

1064
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:16,190
I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.
I like the way you stink.

1065
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:18,692
Let me take this jacket off.

1066
01:16:20,868 --> 01:16:24,406
I was looking at myself in the mirror.
Uh-huh.

1067
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:26,408
I wish I had a pot.

1068
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:32,123
You were looking at yourself in the
mirror and you wish you had some pot?

1069
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:35,126
<i>A</i> pot.
A pot belly.

1070
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:37,332
Pot bellies are sexy.

1071
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,713
Well, you should be happy-

1072
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:41,715
'Cause you have one.

1073
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:45,265
Shut up, fatso.
I don't have a pot.

1074
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:49,185
I have a bit of a tummy, like
Madonna when she did “Lucky Star.”

1075
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,182
It's not the same thing.

1076
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:55,187
I didn't know there was such a difference
between a pot belly and a tummy.

1077
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:57,188
The difference is huge.

1078
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:00,692
Would you like
it if I had a pot belly?

1079
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:02,694
No.

1080
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:07,200
Pot bellies make a man look
either oafish or like a gorilla.

1081
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:10,372
But on a woman
a pot belly's very sexy.

1082
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:15,875
The rest of you is normal-normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal ass-

1083
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:20,004
but with a big,
perfectly round pot belly.

1084
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:23,007
If I had one, I'd wear a
T-shirt two sizes too small...

1085
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:25,008
to accentuate it.

1086
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:27,511
You think men
would find that attractive?

1087
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:30,764
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1088
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:34,314
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch and pleasing to the eye...

1089
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,311
is seldom the same.

1090
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:43,276
If you had a pot belly,
I would punch you in it.

1091
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:46,322
You'd punch me in the belly?
Right in the belly.

1092
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:48,278
Ohh! I'd smother you!

1093
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:52,328
I'd drop it right on your face 'til
you couldn't breathe!

1094
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:54,329
You'd do that?
Yeah.

1095
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:56,331
Promise?
Yeah.

1096
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:01,795
Mmm.
Mmm.

1097
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:06,466
Oh.

1098
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:11,801
Did you get everything?

1099
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:14,895
Yes, I did.
Good job, sugar pop.

1100
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:16,848
Did everything go as planned?

1101
01:18:16,984 --> 01:18:19,726
You didn't listen to the-Ow!

1102
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,686
You didn't listen to the radio?

1103
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:25,068
I never listen to your fights.
Were you the winner?

1104
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:27,400
I won, all right.

1105
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:30,494
Are you still retiring?
Sure am.

1106
01:18:30,581 --> 01:18:32,948
So it all worked out
in the finish.

1107
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:37,789
We're not at the finish
yet, baby.

1108
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:48,630
We're in a lot of danger,
aren't we?

1109
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:53,142
If they find us, they'll kill us,
won't they?

1110
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:58,147
But they won't find us,
will they?

1111
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:03,986
Do you still want me
to go with you?

1112
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:09,196
I don't want to be
a burden or a nuisance. It's-

1113
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:18,121
Say it.

1114
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:20,837
Fabienne,

1115
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:24,041
I want you to be with me.

1116
01:19:24,134 --> 01:19:27,126
Forever?
Forever and ever.

1117
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:31,222
Do you love me?

1118
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:33,299
Very, very much.

1119
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:41,561
Butch.
Yes?

1120
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:45,611
Will you give me oral pleasure?

1121
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:49,073
Will you kiss it?

1122
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:53,157
But you first.

1123
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:56,080
Okay-
okay-

1124
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:08,589
Butch.

1125
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:12,092
<i>Mon amour.
L'aventure commence.</i>

1126
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:30,023
I think I cracked a rib.

1127
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:33,527
Giving me oral pleasure? No,
retard, from the fight.

1128
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:37,030
Don't call me “retard.” My name is Fabby.

1129
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:39,624
My name is Fabienne!
Stop it.

1130
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:41,663
Stop it!
My name is Fabi-

1131
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:44,667
Shut up, fuckhead!
I hate that mongoloid voice.

1132
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:47,795
Okay, okay.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1133
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:50,839
I take it back.

1134
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:55,761
Will you hand me a dry towel,
Miss Beautiful Tulip?

1135
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:59,765
Oh, I like that. I like being
called a tulip.

1136
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:02,267
“Tulip” is much better
than “mongoloid.”

1137
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:05,271
I didn't call you a mongoloid.
I called you a retard.

1138
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:07,477
And I took it back.

1139
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:09,653
Butch?

1140
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:11,606
Yes, lemon pie?

1141
01:21:11,742 --> 01:21:15,155
Where are we going to go?
Well, I'm not sure yet.

1142
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:17,361
Wherever you want.

1143
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:20,369
We're gonna get a lot
of money from this,

1144
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:23,372
but it ain't gonna be
the kind of money...

1145
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:26,375
that we can live like hogs
in the fathouse forever.

1146
01:21:26,465 --> 01:21:30,379
I was thinking maybe we could go
down someplace in the South Pacific.

1147
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:33,837
Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna
carry us a long way down there.

1148
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:36,885
If we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?
You betcha.

1149
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:40,388
And if after a while you didn't dig
that, we could go someplace else.

1150
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:42,390
Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.

1151
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:44,392
But I do not speak Spanish.

1152
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:47,441
Well, you do not speak
Bora-Boran either.

1153
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:49,394
Besides, Mexican's easy.

1154
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:52,443
<i>Donde esta El zapateria?
What does that mean?</i>

1155
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:54,444
Where is the shoe store?

1156
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:56,446
<i>Donde esta-
Spit, please.</i>

1157
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:01,748
<i>Donde esta El zapateria?
Excellent pronunciation.</i>

1158
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:03,912
Mmm.

1159
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:07,245
You'll be my little <i>mamacita</i>

1160

<i>Que hora Es?
Que hora Es?</i>

1161
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:12,129
What time is it?
What time is it?

1162
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:14,802
Time for bed.

1163
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:16,845
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1164
01:22:24,565 --> 01:22:26,476
Butch?

1165
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:34,317
Never mind.

1166
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:48,040
Merde! You startled me.
Did you have a bad dream?

1167
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:02,759
- What is this you're watching?
- A motorcycle movie.

1168
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:04,764
I'm not sure the name.

1169
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:09,773
- Are you watching it?
- In a way.

1170
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:15,655
It's a little early in the morning
for explosions and war.

1171
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:22,950
- What was it about? - How should I
know? You were the one watching it.

1172
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:27,034
- No, imbecile, what was your dream about?
- I don't know.

1173
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:29,038
I don't remember.

1174
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:31,996
It's really rare
that I remember my dreams.

1175
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:35,048
Well, let's look at the
grumpy man in the morning.

1176
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:40,050
Why don't you get up
and we'll get some breakfast.

1177
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,757
One more kiss and <i>I'll</i> get up.

1178
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:48,100
Satisfied? Yep.

1179
01:23:48,232 --> 01:23:51,645
Get up, lazy bones!
Ohh!

1180
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:54,818
Ohh. God.

1181
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:59,573
What time is it?
Almost 9:00 in the morning.

1182
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:03,410
What time does our train arrive?
11:00.

1183
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:07,908
You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast?
What, lemon pie?

1184
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:12,086
I'm gonna order a big plate
of blueberry pancakes...

1185
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:14,083
with maple syrup,

1186
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:17,587
eggs over easy
and five sausages.

1187
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:19,885
Anything to drink with that?

1188
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:23,590
Wow, that looks nice.

1189
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:27,018
To drink-a tall glass
of orange juice...

1190
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:29,471
and a black cup of coffee.

1191
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:34,100
After that, I'm going to have a
slice of pie. Pie for breakfast?

1192
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:38,150
Any time of the
clay is a good time for pie.

1193
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:41,153
Blueberry pie
to go with the pancakes.

1194
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:44,235
And on top, a thin slice
of melted cheese.

1195
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:46,240
Where's my watch?

1196
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:52,918
It's there.

1197
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:55,629
No, it's not.
Have you looked?

1198
01:24:55,716 --> 01:24:59,960
Yes, I've fuckin' looked. What
the fuck do you think I'm doin'?

1199
01:25:00,053 --> 01:25:02,169
You sure you got it?

1200
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:04,551
Yes.
Bedside table drawer.

1201
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:07,759
- On the little kangaroo?
- Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.

1202
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:10,971
Yeah, well, it's not here now.

1203
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:13,939
Well, it should be.

1204
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:17,860
Yes, it most definitely should be, but it's
not here now! So where the fuck is it?

1205
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:26,869
Fabienne, where's my father's
fucking watch?

1206
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:32,955
Do you have any idea what he had to
go through to get me that watch?

1207
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:36,458
I don't have time to go into
it, but he went through a lot.

1208
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:39,961
All this other shit you could've set on
fire, but I specifically reminded you...

1209
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:42,714
not to forget the fucking watch!
Now think.

1210
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:46,339
Did you get it?
I believe so.

1211
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:49,721
“You believe so”? What the fuck does that
mean? You either did or didn't get it.

1212
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:53,061
Then I did.

1213
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:56,307
Are you sure?

1214
01:25:57,444 --> 01:25:59,401
No.

1215
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:03,401
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1216
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:05,779
Motherfucker!
Motherfuckin'-

1217
01:26:07,788 --> 01:26:10,530
Do you know how fucking
stupid you fucking are?

1218
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:12,581
No!

1219
01:26:15,212 --> 01:26:17,123
It's not your fault.

1220
01:26:21,968 --> 01:26:24,380
You left it at the apartment.

1221
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:33,389
If you left it at the apartment,
it's not your fault.

1222
01:26:35,482 --> 01:26:38,565
I had you bring
a bunch of stuff.

1223
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:42,732
I reminded you about it,

1224
01:26:42,823 --> 01:26:47,568
but I didn't illustrate how
personal the watch was to me.

1225
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:51,655
If all I gave a fuck about was the
watch, I shoulda told you that.

1226
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:54,160
You're not a mind reader.

1227
01:26:54,251 --> 01:26:56,162
Are you?

1228
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:08,212
I- I'm sorry.

1229
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:11,890
Don't be. just means I can't
have breakfast with you.

1230
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:14,685
Why does it mean that?

1231
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:20,562
Because I gotta go back to my
apartment and get my watch.

1232
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:24,312
Won't the gangsters
be looking for you there?

1233
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:28,650
Well, that's what
I'm gonna find out.

1234
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:31,953
If they are, and I don't
think I can handle it,

1235
01:27:32,038 --> 01:27:33,949
then I'll split.

1236
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:38,375
I saw your watch. I thought I brought it.
I'm so sorry.

1237
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:46,671
Here's some money.
Go out and get those pancakes.

1238
01:27:46,762 --> 01:27:48,628
Have a nice breakfast.

1239
01:27:48,722 --> 01:27:52,135
I'll take your Honda. I'll be back
before you can say “blueberry pie.”

1240
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:54,637
Blueberry pie.

1241
01:27:54,728 --> 01:27:56,810
Maybe not that fast.

1242
01:27:56,938 --> 01:28:00,101
But pretty fast. Okay? Okay.

1243
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:02,520
Bye.
Bye.

1244
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:05,524
Shit! Of all the fuckin' things
she could fuckin' forget,

1245
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:07,525
she forgets my father's watch!

1246
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:09,527
I specifically reminded her-

1247
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:11,734
Bedside table, on the kangaroo.

1248
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:15,071
I said the words:
“Don't forget my father's watch.”

1467
01:53:45,444 --> 01:53:47,310
with a goddamn hand cannon?

1468
01:53:47,404 --> 01:53:51,363
You see the size of that gun he fired
at us? It was bigger than him.

1469
01:53:56,121 --> 01:53:58,829
We should be fuckin' dead, man.

1470
01:53:58,915 --> 01:54:00,826
I know.
We was lucky.

1471
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:04,000
No, no, no, no.
That shit wasn't luck.

1472
01:54:04,087 --> 01:54:08,297
- Yeah, maybe.
- This was divine intervention.

1473
01:54:08,383 --> 01:54:10,294
You know what
divine intervention is?

1474
01:54:16,183 --> 01:54:18,094
I think so.

1475
01:54:18,185 --> 01:54:21,598
That means that God came down from
heaven and stopped the bullets.

1476
01:54:21,688 --> 01:54:24,100
That's right.
That's exactly what it means.

1477
01:54:24,191 --> 01:54:27,149
God came down from heaven
and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.

1478
01:54:28,403 --> 01:54:30,360
I think it's time for us
to leave, jules.

1479
01:54:30,447 --> 01:54:32,814
Don't do that.
Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!

1480
01:54:32,908 --> 01:54:36,867
- What just happened here was a fuckin'
miracle! - Chill. This shit happens.

1481
01:54:36,953 --> 01:54:39,695
Wrong! Wrong. This shit
doesn't “just happen.”

1482
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:43,203
Do you want to continue this
theological discussion in a car...

1483
01:54:43,293 --> 01:54:45,751
or in a jailhouse with the cops?

1484
01:54:45,837 --> 01:54:48,420
We should be fuckin' dead,
my friend!

1485
01:54:48,507 --> 01:54:52,717
What happened here was a miracle, and
I want you to fucking acknowledge it!

1486
01:54:52,803 --> 01:54:57,513
All right, it was a miracle.
Can we go now?

1487
01:55:04,523 --> 01:55:07,891
Let's go, nigger!
Come on! Shit.

1488
01:55:09,653 --> 01:55:11,610
You ever seen that show <i>Cops?</i>

1489
01:55:11,696 --> 01:55:14,609
I was watching it one time
and there was this cop on,

1490
01:55:14,699 --> 01:55:18,613
and he was talkin' about this gunfight he
had in the hallway with this guy, right?

1491
01:55:18,703 --> 01:55:22,116
He just unloaded on this guy and nothin'
happened. He didn't hit nothin'.

1492
01:55:22,207 --> 01:55:25,120
Okay? It was just him and this guy.

1493
01:55:25,210 --> 01:55:28,544
I mean, you know,
it's-it's freaky, but it happens.

1494
01:55:28,630 --> 01:55:33,545
You wanna play blind man, go walk with the
shepherd, but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.

1495
01:55:33,635 --> 01:55:36,548
- What the fuck does that mean?
- It means that's it for me.

1496
01:55:36,638 --> 01:55:39,255
From here on in, you can
consider my ass retired.

1497
01:55:39,391 --> 01:55:41,553
Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.
Don't blaspheme.

1498
01:55:41,643 --> 01:55:44,681
- I said, don't do that! - Hey, why
are you fuckin' freakin' out on us?

1499
01:55:44,771 --> 01:55:47,809
Look, I'm tellin'
Marsellus today-I'm through.

1500
01:55:47,899 --> 01:55:50,812
- Why don't you tell him at the same
time why? - Don't worry, I will.

1501
01:55:50,902 --> 01:55:54,896
- And I bet you $10,000 he laughs his ass
off. - I don't give a damn if he does.

1502
01:55:54,990 --> 01:55:58,073
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

1503
01:55:58,160 --> 01:56:00,572
Man, I don't <i>even</i>
have an opinion.

1504
01:56:00,662 --> 01:56:04,872
You gotta have an opinion. You think
God came down from heaven and stopped-

1505
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:06,915
What the fuck's happenin'?

1506
01:56:07,043 --> 01:56:08,909
Aw, shit, man!
Aw, man!

1507
01:56:09,045 --> 01:56:11,958
Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.
Why the fuck'd you do that?

1508
01:56:12,048 --> 01:56:13,914
I didn't mean it.
It was an accident.

1509
01:56:14,050 --> 01:56:16,963
Man, I seen some crazy-ass shit in
my time, but this-Chill out, man!

1510
01:56:17,053 --> 01:56:19,966
It was an accident. We probably
went over a bump or somethin'.

1511
01:56:20,056 --> 01:56:21,967
The car ain't hit
no motherfuckin' bump.

1512
01:56:22,058 --> 01:56:25,346
I didn't mean to shoot
the son of a bitch. The gun went off.

1513
01:56:25,437 --> 01:56:28,805
Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on a
city street in broad daylight here!

1514
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:31,853
I don't believe it! Well,
believe it now, motherfucker!

1515
01:56:31,943 --> 01:56:35,356
We gotta get this car off the road. Cops
notice shit like a car drenched in blood.

1516
01:56:35,489 --> 01:56:38,409
Just take it to a friendly place, that's
all! This is the Valley, Vincent.

1517
01:56:38,492 --> 01:56:40,859
Marsellus ain't got no
friendly places in the Valley.

1518
01:56:40,994 --> 01:56:43,861
Well Jules, this ain't my
fuckin' town, man! Shit!

1519
01:56:43,997 --> 01:56:46,864
What you doing? I'm calling
my partner in Toluca Lake.

1520
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:50,538
Where's Toluca Lake? Over the
hill here, by Burbank Studios.

1521
01:56:50,629 --> 01:56:53,542
If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't
know what the fuck we gonna do,

1522
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:56,545
'cause I ain't got
no other partners in 818.

1523
01:56:56,635 --> 01:56:59,548
Jimmie, how you doin', man?
It's Jules. just listen up, man.

1524
01:56:59,638 --> 01:57:03,552
Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we
gotta get it off' the road, pronto.

1525
01:57:03,642 --> 01:57:05,804
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

1526
01:57:07,312 --> 01:57:10,225
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie situation.

1527
01:57:10,315 --> 01:57:13,899
He's one remark away from
kickin' our asses out the door.

1528
01:57:14,027 --> 01:57:16,940
If he does, what do we do? We ain't
leavin' 'til we make a couple calls,

1529
01:57:17,030 --> 01:57:19,943
but I don't want it to reach
that pitch-Jimmie's a friend.

1530
01:57:20,033 --> 01:57:22,953
You don't come into your friend's house
and start tellin' him what's what.

1531
01:57:23,036 --> 01:57:24,947
Just tell him not to be abusive.

1532
01:57:25,038 --> 01:57:27,016
He kinda freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.

1533
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:30,203
Put yourself in his position-It's
8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.

1534
01:57:30,293 --> 01:57:32,204
He wasn't expectin' this shit.

1535
01:57:32,295 --> 01:57:35,208
We gotta remember here
who's doin' who a favour.

1536
01:57:35,298 --> 01:57:39,166
If that favour means I gotta take shit, he
can stick that favour straight up his ass.

1537
01:57:39,302 --> 01:57:43,170
Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd you just do
to his towel, man? I was dryin' my hands!

1538
01:57:43,306 --> 01:57:46,173
You're supposed to wash 'em first!
You watched me wash 'em.

1539
01:57:46,309 --> 01:57:49,847
I watched you get 'em wet. I was washin'
'em. This shit's hard to get off.

1540
01:57:49,938 --> 01:57:51,898
Maybe if he'd had Lava
I coulda done a better job.

1541
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:53,851
I used the same
fuckin' soap you did,

1542
01:57:53,942 --> 01:57:56,855
and when I finished, the towel didn't
look like no goddamn maxi-pad!

1543
01:57:56,945 --> 01:57:59,858
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?

1544
01:57:59,948 --> 01:58:04,033
It's shit like this that's gonna
bring this situation to a head, man!

1545
01:58:04,119 --> 01:58:07,532
Look, I ain't threatenin' you
or nothin', all right?

1546
01:58:07,622 --> 01:58:12,082
You know I respect you and all. But just
don't put me in this position, all right?

1547
01:58:12,168 --> 01:58:14,830
All right.
Fine. Fine.

1548
01:58:14,921 --> 01:58:17,834
Ask me nice like that,
no problem.

1549
01:58:17,924 --> 01:58:20,882
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

1550
01:58:22,596 --> 01:58:25,463
Mmm!
Goddamn, Jimmie!

1551
01:58:25,557 --> 01:58:27,594
This some serious gourmet shit.

1552
01:58:27,684 --> 01:58:29,641
Me and Vincent
would've been satisfied...

1553
01:58:29,728 --> 01:58:31,639
with some freeze-dried
Taster's Choice.

1554
01:58:31,730 --> 01:58:33,641
Right?

1555
01:58:33,732 --> 01:58:36,645
And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.

1556
01:58:36,735 --> 01:58:38,772
- What flavour is this?
- Knock it off, Julie.

1557
01:58:38,862 --> 01:58:42,901
- What? - I don't need you to tell
me how fuckin' good my coffee is.

1558
01:58:42,991 --> 01:58:45,483
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

1559
01:58:45,577 --> 01:58:47,443
When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.

1560
01:58:47,537 --> 01:58:51,155
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff' cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

1561
01:58:51,249 --> 01:58:55,163
But you know what's on my mind right now?
It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.

1562
01:58:55,253 --> 01:58:57,415
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.

1563
01:58:57,505 --> 01:59:00,945
- Jimmie, don't even worry... Don't tell me
about anything. I wanna ask you a question.

1564
01:59:01,009 --> 01:59:02,920
When you came pulling in here,

1565
01:59:03,011 --> 01:59:06,240
did you notice the sign on the front of my
house that said, “Dead nigger storage”?

1566
01:59:06,264 --> 01:59:09,677
- You know I ain't seen no... Did you
notice the sign on the front of my house...

1567
01:59:09,768 --> 01:59:11,679
that said,
“Dead nigger storage”?

1568
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:14,478
No. I didn't.

1569
01:59:14,606 --> 01:59:17,473
You know why you didn't see that sign?
Why?

1570
01:59:17,567 --> 01:59:22,107
'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead
niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!

1571
01:59:22,197 --> 01:59:25,110
- We're not gonna store the motherfucker-
- Don't you fuckin' realize...

1572
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:29,615
that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead
body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced?

1573
01:59:29,704 --> 01:59:32,913
No marriage counsellor. No trial separation.
I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.

1574
01:59:32,999 --> 01:59:36,333
Okay? And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced!

1575
01:59:36,419 --> 01:59:41,414
Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,
but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.

1576
01:59:41,508 --> 01:59:43,590
Jimmie, jimmie,
she ain't gonna leave you.

1577
01:59:43,677 --> 01:59:47,591
Don't fuckin' “Jimmie” me, Jules! Okay?
Don't fuckin' “Jimmie” me.

1578
01:59:47,681 --> 01:59:51,640
There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna
make me forget I love my wife. ls there?

1579
01:59:54,771 --> 01:59:59,436
Now, look, you know, she comes home
from work in about an hour and a half.

1580
01:59:59,526 --> 02:00:02,143
The graveyard shift at the hospital.

1581
02:00:02,237 --> 02:00:05,730
You gotta make some phone calls?
You gotta call some people?

1582
02:00:05,824 --> 02:00:09,738
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck
out of my house before she gets here.

1583
02:00:09,828 --> 02:00:12,741
That's Kool and the Gang. We
don't wanna fuck your shit up.

1584
02:00:12,831 --> 02:00:15,744
All I wanna do is call my people
and get 'em to bring us in.

1585
02:00:15,834 --> 02:00:18,747
You're fucking my shit up
right now!

1586
02:00:18,837 --> 02:00:21,920
You're gonna fuck my shit up
big time if Bonnie comes home.

1587
02:00:22,006 --> 02:00:25,499
Do me that favour, all right? The phone is
in my bedroom. I suggest you get going.

1588
02:00:25,593 --> 02:00:28,506
Well, say she comes home.

1589
02:00:28,596 --> 02:00:31,008
What do you think she'll do?

1590
02:00:32,517 --> 02:00:34,929
Oh, no fuckin' shit
she'll freak.

1591
02:00:35,019 --> 02:00:37,226
That ain't no kinda answer.

1592
02:00:37,313 --> 02:00:40,351
I mean, you know, I don't.
How much? A lot or a little?

1593
02:00:40,442 --> 02:00:43,275
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element...

1594
02:00:43,361 --> 02:00:45,272
this Bonnie situation is.

1595
02:00:45,363 --> 02:00:49,277
<i>She comes home from a hard days work, finds
a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen. .</i>.

1596
02:00:49,367 --> 02:00:51,278
<i>Doing a bunch of gangster shit,</i>

1597
02:00:51,369 --> 02:00:54,452
<i>there ain't no tellin'
what she's liable to do.</i>

1598
02:00:56,624 --> 02:00:58,535
Yeah, I grasp that, jules.

1599
02:00:58,626 --> 02:01:01,209
All I'm doing is
contemplating the ifs.

1600
02:01:01,296 --> 02:01:04,209
I don't wanna hear about
no motherfuckin' ifs!

1601
02:01:04,299 --> 02:01:08,213
All I want to hear from your ass is, “You ain't
got no problem, Jules, I'm on the motherfucker.

1602
02:01:08,303 --> 02:01:12,422
Chill them niggers out and wait for the
cavalry, which should be coming directly.”

1603
02:01:12,515 --> 02:01:15,678
You ain't got no problem, jules.

1604
02:01:15,769 --> 02:01:17,885
I'm on the motherfucker.

1605
02:01:17,979 --> 02:01:23,019
Chill them niggers out and wait for the
Wolf, who should be coming directly.

1606
02:01:23,109 --> 02:01:25,521
You sendin' the Wolf?

1607
02:01:25,612 --> 02:01:27,774
Oh, you feel better,
motherfucker?

1608
02:01:27,864 --> 02:01:30,151
Shit, yeah, Negro!

1609
02:01:30,241 --> 02:01:33,279
That's all you had to say!

1610
02:01:33,411 --> 02:01:36,574
♪♪ She
the hysterical type?

1611
02:01:36,706 --> 02:01:39,619
When is she due?

1612
02:01:39,709 --> 02:01:41,791
Mm-hmm.

1613
02:01:41,878 --> 02:01:43,789
Give me the principals'
names again.

1614
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:45,791
Place your bets.

1615
02:01:46,883 --> 02:01:50,501
Jules. Mm-hmm.
Cards, please.

1616
02:01:50,595 --> 02:01:52,552
Vincent.

1617
02:01:57,268 --> 02:01:59,225
Jimmie.

1618
02:02:00,438 --> 02:02:02,600
Bonnie. Mm-hmm.

1619
02:02:07,987 --> 02:02:10,945
It's 30 minutes away.
I'll be there in 10.

1620
02:02:27,924 --> 02:02:30,791
You're... jimmie, right?
This is your house?

1621
02:02:30,927 --> 02:02:34,511
It sure is. I'm Winston Wolf.
I solve problems.

1622
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:37,552
Good. We got one. Sol heard.
May I come in?

1623
02:02:37,642 --> 02:02:39,508
Uh, yeah. Please do.

1624
02:02:39,602 --> 02:02:43,266
You must be Jules.
Which would make you... Vincent.

1625
02:02:43,356 --> 02:02:45,768
Let's get down
to brass tacks, gentlemen.

1626
02:02:45,859 --> 02:02:48,772
If I was informed correctly, the clock
is ticking. ls that right, jimmie?

1627
02:02:48,862 --> 02:02:50,728
Uh, one hundred percent.

1628
02:02:50,864 --> 02:02:54,778
Your wife Bonnie comes home at
9:30 in the a.m., correct? Uh-huh.

1629
02:02:54,868 --> 02:02:59,328
I was led to believe if she comes home and finds
us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much.

1630
02:02:59,455 --> 02:03:03,699
She wouldn't at that. That gives us 40
minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge,

1631
02:03:03,793 --> 02:03:07,252
which, if you do what I say,
when I say it, should be plenty.

1632
02:03:07,338 --> 02:03:11,673
Now, you got a corpse in a car, minus
a head, in a garage. Take me to it.

1633
02:03:19,392 --> 02:03:21,303
Jimmie.
Uh-huh.

1634
02:03:21,394 --> 02:03:24,762
Do me a favour, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee back there.

1635
02:03:24,898 --> 02:03:28,357
Would you make me a cup?
Uh, yeah, sure.

1636
02:03:29,819 --> 02:03:32,732
Oh, uh, um, how do you take it?

1637
02:03:32,822 --> 02:03:35,359
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1638
02:03:37,452 --> 02:03:40,865
About the car, is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall?

1639
02:03:40,955 --> 02:03:44,323
Does it smoke? Does it make a lot of noise?
Is there gas in it?

1640
02:03:44,459 --> 02:03:47,872
Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.
Positive?

1641
02:03:47,962 --> 02:03:51,330
Don't get me on the road and I find
out the brake lights don't work.

1642
02:03:51,466 --> 02:03:55,505
As far as I know, the motherfucker's
tip-top. Good enough.

1643
02:03:55,595 --> 02:03:57,586
Let's go back to the kitchen.

1644
02:04:03,269 --> 02:04:06,227
Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
Thank you, jimmie.

1645
02:04:11,069 --> 02:04:12,980
Mmm.

1646
02:04:14,072 --> 02:04:16,154
Okay, first thing.
You two.

1647
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:19,153
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

1648
02:04:19,243 --> 02:04:21,905
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1649
02:04:22,038 --> 02:04:25,997
That would lead me to believe you got
cleansers and shit. Yeah. Under the sink.

1650
02:04:26,084 --> 02:04:29,497
Good. What I need you two fellas to
do is take those cleaning products...

1651
02:04:29,587 --> 02:04:33,581
and clean the inside of the car-
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1652
02:04:33,675 --> 02:04:37,589
Go in the back seat, scoop up all those
little pieces of brain and skull.

1653
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:40,592
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1654
02:04:40,682 --> 02:04:43,595
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1655
02:04:43,685 --> 02:04:48,020
Just give it a good once-over. What you need
to take care of are the really messy parts.

1656
02:04:48,106 --> 02:04:52,191
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

1657
02:04:52,276 --> 02:04:54,688
We need to raid
your linen closet.

1658
02:04:54,779 --> 02:04:57,692
I need blankets, I need
comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1659
02:04:57,782 --> 02:05:01,400
The thicker the better, the darker the
better. No whites. Can't use 'em.

1660
02:05:01,494 --> 02:05:06,785
We'll need to camouflage the front
seat and back seat and floorboards...

1661
02:05:06,874 --> 02:05:08,785
with quilts and blankets,

1662
02:05:08,876 --> 02:05:12,790
so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout
in the car, the subterfuge won't last,

1663
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:15,713
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1664
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:17,837
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

1665
02:05:17,927 --> 02:05:19,668
“Please” would be nice.

1666
02:05:21,139 --> 02:05:24,131
- Come again?
- I said, a “please” would be nice.

1667
02:05:25,977 --> 02:05:29,845
Get it straight, Buster. I'm not here to say
please. I'm here to tell you what to do.

1668
02:05:31,649 --> 02:05:34,562
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

1669
02:05:34,652 --> 02:05:37,064
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1670
02:05:37,155 --> 02:05:41,023
I'm here to help. If my help's not
appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1671
02:05:41,117 --> 02:05:44,405
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.

1672
02:05:44,495 --> 02:05:47,408
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't mean
disrespect, okay? I respect you.

1673
02:05:47,498 --> 02:05:50,331
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

1674
02:05:50,418 --> 02:05:53,410
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

1675
02:05:53,504 --> 02:05:58,123
I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys
to act fast if you wanna get out of this.

1676
02:05:58,217 --> 02:06:01,676
So pretty please, with sugar
on top, clean the fuckin' car.

1677
02:06:06,184 --> 02:06:09,848
Don't be lookin' at me like that,
all right? I can feel your look.

1678
02:06:12,565 --> 02:06:15,227
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1679
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:19,231
Green.

1680
02:06:20,865 --> 02:06:23,778
Nothin' except for
the mess inside.

1681
02:06:25,995 --> 02:06:28,407
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

1682
02:06:29,916 --> 02:06:31,873
Nobody who'll be missed.

1683
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:36,878
You're a good man, joe.
Thanks a bunch.

1684
02:06:37,965 --> 02:06:39,876
How we comin', Jimmie?
Pretty good.

1685
02:06:39,967 --> 02:06:43,085
I got it all here, but, uh,

1686
02:06:43,221 --> 02:06:46,634
Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something.
Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

1687
02:06:46,724 --> 02:06:50,217
Okay. You gotta understand
something, uh, Winston.

1688
02:06:50,311 --> 02:06:52,222
Uh-Uh, no,
thank you.

1689
02:06:52,313 --> 02:06:55,431
Uh, this is our best linen here,

1690
02:06:55,525 --> 02:06:58,438
and it's, uh-
it was a wedding present...

1691
02:06:58,528 --> 02:07:00,895
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny.

1692
02:07:01,030 --> 02:07:05,445
They're not with us anymore. I wanna
help-Let me ask you a question.

1693
02:07:05,535 --> 02:07:08,448
If you don't mind. No, no, please.
Go ahead.

1694
02:07:10,039 --> 02:07:14,909
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt
Ginny, were they millionaires?

1695
02:07:16,087 --> 02:07:17,998
No.

1696
02:07:18,089 --> 02:07:20,501
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

1697
02:07:20,591 --> 02:07:23,959
And I'm positive that if
Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

1698
02:07:24,095 --> 02:07:26,507
Ginny.
Ginny were here,

1699
02:07:26,597 --> 02:07:30,841
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set,

1700
02:07:30,935 --> 02:07:34,098
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

1701
02:07:38,067 --> 02:07:41,981
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.

1702
02:07:43,114 --> 02:07:45,071
How about you, jimmie?

1703
02:07:46,284 --> 02:07:48,241
You an oak man?

1704
02:07:49,328 --> 02:07:51,285
Oak's nice.

1705
02:07:57,128 --> 02:08:00,962
Oh, man, I will never forgive
your ass for this shit.

1706
02:08:01,048 --> 02:08:03,460
This is some fucked-up,
repugnant shit.

1707
02:08:03,551 --> 02:08:06,964
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits that he is wrong,

1708
02:08:07,054 --> 02:08:09,967
that he is immediately forgiven
for all wrongdoings?

1709
02:08:10,057 --> 02:08:12,970
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit!

1710
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:15,956
The motherfucker that said that shit never
had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull...

1711
02:08:15,980 --> 02:08:19,723
on account of your dumb ass. I got a threshold,
jules, for the abuse that I will take.

1712
02:08:19,817 --> 02:08:23,401
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,
and you got me in the red.

1713
02:08:23,487 --> 02:08:26,900
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1714
02:08:26,991 --> 02:08:28,857
That's all. I could blow.

1715
02:08:28,993 --> 02:08:30,904
Oh, you ready to blow?
Yeah.

1716
02:08:30,995 --> 02:08:33,908
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'
motherfucker, motherfucker.

1717
02:08:33,998 --> 02:08:36,911
Every time my fingers touch brain,
I'm Superfly T.N.T.

1718
02:08:37,001 --> 02:08:38,912
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

1719
02:08:39,003 --> 02:08:41,916
In fact, what the fuck
am I doin' in the back?

1720
02:08:42,006 --> 02:08:45,249
You're the motherfucker should be on
brain detail! We're fuckin' switchin'!

1721
02:08:45,343 --> 02:08:47,801
I'm washin' windows, you're
pickin' up this nigger's skull!

1722
02:08:57,521 --> 02:08:59,478
Fine job, gentlemen.

1723
02:09:00,816 --> 02:09:03,228
You may get out of this yet.

1724
02:09:03,319 --> 02:09:05,731
I can't believe
this is the same car.

1725
02:09:05,821 --> 02:09:09,234
Well, let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.

1726
02:09:09,325 --> 02:09:12,738
Phase one is complete-clean the car-
which moves us right along to phase two:

1727
02:09:12,828 --> 02:09:14,739
clean you two.

1728
02:09:16,332 --> 02:09:18,164
Strip.

1729
02:09:18,292 --> 02:09:22,035
All the way?
To your bare ass.

1730
02:09:22,129 --> 02:09:25,167
Quickly, gentlemen.
We got about 15 minutes...

1731
02:09:25,258 --> 02:09:28,171
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.

1732
02:09:28,261 --> 02:09:30,753
Goddamn, this morning air
is some chilly shit.

1733
02:09:30,846 --> 02:09:32,757
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

1734
02:09:32,848 --> 02:09:35,260
- You know what you two look like?
- What?

1735
02:09:35,351 --> 02:09:38,764
Like a couple of guys who
just blew off somebody's head.

1736
02:09:38,854 --> 02:09:42,222
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

1737
02:09:46,529 --> 02:09:48,987
Toss 'em in Jimmie's
garbage bag.

1738
02:09:49,073 --> 02:09:53,488
Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this
shit out front for the garbageman to pick up.

1739
02:09:53,577 --> 02:09:57,787
Don't worry, we're taking it with us.
Jim, the soap.

1740
02:09:59,250 --> 02:10:01,161
Vincent. Okay, gentlemen.

1741
02:10:01,252 --> 02:10:04,711
You both been to county
before, I'm sure. Here it comes.

1742
02:10:04,839 --> 02:10:07,706
Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!
Yo! Yo! Yo!

1743
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:10,963
Better you than me, gentlemen.

1744
02:10:11,095 --> 02:10:14,008
Don't be afraid of the soap. Spread
it around.

1745
02:10:14,098 --> 02:10:16,965
- Get 'em there a little bit. Vincent's
hair. - Hey, get out of my hair!

1746
02:10:17,059 --> 02:10:19,926
- Come on, do it, goddamn it! Do it!
- Uh, um-

1747
02:10:21,022 --> 02:10:22,933
Towel.

1748
02:10:33,451 --> 02:10:36,614
You're dry enough.
Toss 'em their clothes.

1749
02:10:36,704 --> 02:10:39,992
Perfect.

1750
02:10:40,082 --> 02:10:43,495
Perfect. We couldn't have
planned this better.

1751
02:10:43,586 --> 02:10:45,497
You guys look like-

1752
02:10:45,588 --> 02:10:47,955
What do they look like, Jimmie?

1753
02:10:48,090 --> 02:10:51,674
Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.

1754
02:10:51,761 --> 02:10:55,254
- - Ha-ha-ha.
They're your clothes, motherfucker.

1755
02:10:55,348 --> 02:10:58,056
Come on, gentlemen. We're laughing
our way right into prison.

1756
02:10:58,142 --> 02:11:00,099
Don't make me beg.

1757
02:11:03,147 --> 02:11:06,560
Okay, gentlemen, let's get our
rules of the road straight.

1758
02:11:06,650 --> 02:11:10,188
We're going to a place called
Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1759
02:11:10,279 --> 02:11:13,192
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1760
02:11:13,282 --> 02:11:15,148
The place is North Hollywood,

1761
02:11:15,242 --> 02:11:19,236
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1762
02:11:19,330 --> 02:11:22,664
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

1763
02:11:24,043 --> 02:11:26,000
Vincent, you follow in my Acura.

1764
02:11:26,087 --> 02:11:29,921
Now, if we come across the
path of any John Q. Laws,

1765
02:11:30,049 --> 02:11:33,132
nobody does a fuckin' thing
'til I do something. Right.

1766
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:36,093
What did I say?
Don't do shit unless.

1767
02:11:36,222 --> 02:11:38,509
Unless what?
Unless you do it first.

1768
02:11:38,599 --> 02:11:40,966
Spoken like a true prodigy.

1769
02:11:41,060 --> 02:11:44,473
How about you, Lash LaRue? Can you keep
your spurs from jingling and jangling?

1770
02:11:44,563 --> 02:11:48,682
The gun went off. I don't know why.
I'm cool, I promise you.

1771
02:11:48,776 --> 02:11:51,689
Fair enough. Now, I drive real
fuckin' fast, so keep up.

1772
02:11:51,779 --> 02:11:54,271
If I get my car back any
different than I gave it,

1773
02:11:54,365 --> 02:11:57,232
Monster Joe's gonna be
disposing of two bodies.

1774
02:12:01,122 --> 02:12:02,829
Outta my way, Rex.

1775
02:12:04,375 --> 02:12:06,787
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.

1776
02:12:06,877 --> 02:12:10,620
- All right.
- Boys, this is Raquel.

1777
02:12:10,714 --> 02:12:13,331
Someday all this will be hers.

1778
02:12:13,426 --> 02:12:16,214
Hi. So, what's with the outfits?

1779
02:12:16,345 --> 02:12:19,758
You guys going to a volleyball
game or something?

1780
02:12:19,849 --> 02:12:22,307
I'm takin' milady
out to breakfast.

1781
02:12:22,393 --> 02:12:25,055
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

1782
02:12:25,187 --> 02:12:26,552
Redondo.
Inglewood.

1783
02:12:26,647 --> 02:12:30,060
It's-
It's your future. I-

1784
02:12:30,151 --> 02:12:32,893
I see a-
a cab ride.

1785
02:12:32,987 --> 02:12:35,945
Move outta the sticks, fellas.
Say good night, Raquel.

1786
02:12:36,031 --> 02:12:38,944
Good night, Raquel. I'll
see you guys around.

1787
02:12:39,034 --> 02:12:41,446
Stay outta trouble,
you crazy kids.

1788
02:12:41,537 --> 02:12:45,451
Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was
a real pleasure watching you work.

1789
02:12:45,541 --> 02:12:48,454
Yeah, really. And thank
you very much, Mr. Wolf.

1790
02:12:48,544 --> 02:12:50,455
Call me Winston.

1791
02:12:52,047 --> 02:12:54,914
- You see that, young lady?
- Respect

1792
02:12:55,050 --> 02:12:59,169
Respect for one's elders shows character.
I have character.

1793
02:12:59,305 --> 02:13:03,299
Because you are a character doesn't mean
that you have character.

1794
02:13:09,899 --> 02:13:12,812
Wanna share a cab?

1795
02:13:12,943 --> 02:13:17,187
I'd go for some breakfast. Feel like
havin' breakfast with me?

1796
02:13:17,281 --> 02:13:19,943
Cool.

1797
02:13:24,079 --> 02:13:27,162
I don't know why, I just thought
he'd be European or something.

1798
02:13:27,291 --> 02:13:30,659
Yeah, he's about as European as
fuckin' English Bob. I know that now.

1799
02:13:30,794 --> 02:13:33,206
But was he cool or what?
Thank you.

1800
02:13:33,297 --> 02:13:35,709
Totally fuckin' cool,
in control.

1801
02:13:35,799 --> 02:13:39,793
Didn't even really get pissed when you
were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.

1802
02:13:39,929 --> 02:13:42,512
Want some bacon?

1803
02:13:42,598 --> 02:13:44,464
No, man, I don't eat pork.

1804
02:13:44,600 --> 02:13:47,968
Are you Jewish? I ain't Jewish; I
just don't dig on swine, that's all.

1805
02:13:48,103 --> 02:13:51,016
Why not?
Pigs are filthy animals.

1806
02:13:51,106 --> 02:13:53,017
I don't eat filthy animals.

1807
02:13:53,108 --> 02:13:56,521
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.
Pork chops taste good.

1808
02:13:56,612 --> 02:13:59,525
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin
pie, but I'd never know...

1809
02:13:59,615 --> 02:14:02,528
'cause I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.

1810
02:14:02,618 --> 02:14:05,531
Pigs sleep and root in shit.
That's a filthy animal.

1811
02:14:05,621 --> 02:14:09,489
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense
enough to disregard its own faeces.

1812
02:14:09,625 --> 02:14:13,914
How about a dog? Dog eats its own faeces.
I don't eat dog either.

1813
02:14:14,004 --> 02:14:17,338
Yeah, but do you consider
a dog to be a filthy animal?

1814
02:14:17,424 --> 02:14:20,337
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy,

1815
02:14:20,427 --> 02:14:22,293
but they're definitely dirty.

1816
02:14:22,429 --> 02:14:26,548
But a dog's got personality. Personality
goes a long way. Ah, so, by that rationale,

1817
02:14:26,642 --> 02:14:30,135
if a pig had a better personality,
he would cease to be a filthy animal.

1818
02:14:30,271 --> 02:14:34,185
Is that true? We'd have to be talkin'
about one charming motherfuckin' pig.

1819
02:14:34,275 --> 02:14:38,269
I mean, he'd have to be 10 times more
charming than that Arnold on <i>Green</i> Acres.

1820
02:14:43,909 --> 02:14:46,025
Oh, man, that's good.

1821
02:14:46,120 --> 02:14:49,704
That's good, man.
You're startin' to lighten up.

1822
02:14:49,790 --> 02:14:52,703
You've been sittin' there,
all serious and shit.

1823
02:14:52,835 --> 02:14:55,293
I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.
About what?

1824
02:14:55,379 --> 02:14:58,292
- About the miracle we witnessed.
- Miracle you witnessed.

1825
02:14:58,382 --> 02:15:01,591
- I witnessed a freak occurrence.
- What is a miracle, Vincent?

1826
02:15:03,554 --> 02:15:06,717
Act of God.
And what's an act of God?

1827
02:15:10,227 --> 02:15:14,061
When, um, God makes
the impossible possible.

1828
02:15:15,065 --> 02:15:16,931
But this morning...

1829
02:15:17,067 --> 02:15:19,775
I don't think qualifies.
Hey, Vincent.

1830
02:15:19,862 --> 02:15:23,571
See, that shit don't matter. You're
judging this shit the wrong way.

1831
02:15:23,657 --> 02:15:28,572
It could be God stopped the bullets,
changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys.

1832
02:15:28,662 --> 02:15:31,620
You don't judge shit
like this based on merit.

1833
02:15:31,707 --> 02:15:34,165
Now, whether or not
what we experienced...

1834
02:15:34,251 --> 02:15:37,369
was an According-to-Hoyle
miracle is insignificant.

1835
02:15:37,463 --> 02:15:41,206
But what is significant is,
I felt the touch of God.

1836
02:15:41,300 --> 02:15:43,211
God got involved.

1837
02:15:43,302 --> 02:15:45,009
But Why?

1838
02:15:45,095 --> 02:15:48,133
Well, that's what's fuckin'
with me: I don't know why.

1839
02:15:48,223 --> 02:15:51,181
- But I can't go back to sleep.
- You're serious.

1840
02:15:51,268 --> 02:15:53,100
You're really thinkin' about quittin'.

1841
02:15:53,228 --> 02:15:55,890
<i>For Ne? Most definitely. Yeah.</i>

1842
02:15:55,981 --> 02:15:59,315
Fuck.
What you gonna do then?

1843
02:16:00,653 --> 02:16:04,863
Well, that's what I been
sitting here contemplating.

1844
02:16:04,948 --> 02:16:08,532
First I'm gonna deliver
this case to Marsellus.

1845
02:16:08,619 --> 02:16:11,702
Then, basically, I'm just
gonna walk the earth.

1846
02:16:11,789 --> 02:16:15,202
- What you mean, “Walk the earth”?
- Like Caine in <i>Kung</i> Fu.

1847
02:16:15,292 --> 02:16:18,250
Walk from place to place,
meet people, get in adventures.

1848
02:16:18,337 --> 02:16:20,578
And how long do you intend
to walk the earth?

1849
02:16:20,673 --> 02:16:23,961
- 'Til God puts me where he wants me to be.
- What if he don't do that?

1850
02:16:24,051 --> 02:16:28,966
- If it takes forever, then <i>I'll</i> walk forever.
- So you decided to be a bum.

1851
02:16:29,056 --> 02:16:32,674
<i>I'll</i> just be Jules, Vincent.
No more, no less.

1852
02:16:32,768 --> 02:16:34,725
No, jules,
you decided to be a bum,

1853
02:16:34,812 --> 02:16:38,100
just like all those pieces of shit
out there who beg for change,

1854
02:16:38,190 --> 02:16:41,103
who sleep in garbage bins,
eat what I throw away.

1855
02:16:41,193 --> 02:16:44,151
They got a name for that, jules-
It's called a bum.

1856
02:16:44,238 --> 02:16:47,902
And without a job, a residence or legal
tender, that's what you're gonna be, man.

1857
02:16:47,991 --> 02:16:49,857
You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.

1858
02:16:49,952 --> 02:16:52,865
Look, my friend,
this is just where you and I differ.

1859
02:16:52,955 --> 02:16:55,788
Garcon! Coffee!

1860
02:16:55,874 --> 02:17:00,368
Jules, look, what happened this
morning, man, I agree it was peculiar.

1861
02:17:00,462 --> 02:17:03,545
- But water into wine, I-
- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.

1862
02:17:03,632 --> 02:17:06,750
- Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man.
- If my answers frighten you,

1863
02:17:06,844 --> 02:17:09,381
then you should cease
asking scary questions.

1864
02:17:12,307 --> 02:17:14,218
I'm gonna take a shit.

1865
02:17:17,104 --> 02:17:19,641
Let me ask you something.

1866
02:17:19,732 --> 02:17:23,100
When did you make this decision, when you
were sittin' there eatin' that muffin?

1867
02:17:23,193 --> 02:17:27,107
Yeah. I was sittin' here eatin'
my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,

1868
02:17:27,197 --> 02:17:29,108
replayin' the incident
in my head,

1869
02:17:29,199 --> 02:17:32,988
when I had what alcoholics refer
to as a moment of clarity.

1870
02:17:33,078 --> 02:17:36,196
Fuck.
To be continued.

1871
02:17:48,218 --> 02:17:51,176
I love you, pumpkin.
I love you, honey bunny.

1872
02:17:52,765 --> 02:17:55,678
Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!

1873
02:17:55,768 --> 02:18:00,729
Any one of you fucking pricks move and I'll
execute every one of you motherfuckers!

1874
02:18:00,856 --> 02:18:04,224
You got that? You just be quiet over there!
Waitresses on the floor!

1875
02:18:04,318 --> 02:18:07,356
Get on the fuckin'-
get the fuck down!

1876
02:18:07,446 --> 02:18:12,156
You're in a blind spot. Take your dames
over to that booth, on the count of ten!

1877
02:18:12,242 --> 02:18:16,782
- Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen!
- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-

1878
02:18:16,872 --> 02:18:19,955
What the fuck are you doing,
you fucking yuppie? Get down!

1879
02:18:20,042 --> 02:18:22,454
- Get down!
- Th row those bags!

1880
02:18:22,586 --> 02:18:25,044
<i>Fucking move! Move!</i>

1881
02:18:25,172 --> 02:18:27,413
Move! Get the fuck-

1882
02:18:27,508 --> 02:18:30,500
Get down on the fucking floor!

1883
02:18:30,594 --> 02:18:32,505
Grandpa! Down!

1884
02:18:32,596 --> 02:18:35,930
I'm the manager here, and there's
no problem. No problem at all.

1885
02:18:36,058 --> 02:18:38,971
You gonna give me a problem?
No, sir, I'm not.

1886
02:18:39,061 --> 02:18:43,055
Thought you said you were gonna
give me a fucking problem!

1887
02:18:43,148 --> 02:18:47,813
- I think we got a hero here, honey bunny.
- Well, just execute him!

1888
02:18:47,903 --> 02:18:49,860
I am not a hero.

1889
02:18:49,947 --> 02:18:52,939
I'm just a coffee shop manager.
Get the fuck down!

1890
02:18:53,033 --> 02:18:54,774
The restaurant's ours!

1891
02:18:54,868 --> 02:18:57,781
Just take whatever you want.

1892
02:18:57,871 --> 02:18:59,782
You talk to the customers. Yeah.

1893
02:18:59,873 --> 02:19:02,991
You tell them to be fucking cool
and everything will be over.

1894
02:19:03,085 --> 02:19:05,042
You understand me?
Yes!

1895
02:19:07,339 --> 02:19:11,207
Listen, everybody.
Be calm, cooperate,

1896
02:19:11,301 --> 02:19:14,214
and this'll all be over
in a minute!

1897
02:19:14,304 --> 02:19:16,261
Get the fuck down!
Well done.

1898
02:19:16,348 --> 02:19:19,807
<i>♪♪</i>

1899
02:19:28,610 --> 02:19:32,069
All right, now, people, gonna come
around and collect your wallets!

1900
02:19:32,155 --> 02:19:35,568
You don't fucking talk, you just
throw 'em in the bag! Are we clear?

1901
02:19:35,659 --> 02:19:37,900
I said, are we fucking clear?

1902
02:19:37,995 --> 02:19:40,862
Good!
Now, wallets out!

1903
02:19:40,956 --> 02:19:44,540
That's it. Get the fuck down.
In the bag.

1904
02:19:44,668 --> 02:19:47,581
In the fucking bag! I
don't have nothin' on me, man.

1905
02:19:47,671 --> 02:19:49,503
In the bag.

1906
02:19:49,590 --> 02:19:52,503
What am I waiting for?
In the fucking bag.

1907
02:19:52,593 --> 02:19:55,506
Laura. Laura. Tips.
In the bag.

1908
02:19:55,596 --> 02:19:57,803
Is that a cellular phone? Yeah.

1909
02:19:57,890 --> 02:19:59,847
In the fucking bag.

1910
02:20:01,393 --> 02:20:04,852
Tidy up, tidy up, that's it. Now
get the fuck down on the floor.

1911
02:20:04,938 --> 02:20:07,350
In the bag.
In the bag.

1912
02:20:19,536 --> 02:20:21,493
In the bag.

1913
02:20:36,595 --> 02:20:39,508
- What's in the case?
- My boss' dirty laundry.

1914
02:20:39,598 --> 02:20:42,135
Your boss makes you do his laundry?
When he wants it clean.

1915
02:20:42,225 --> 02:20:44,887
- Sounds like a shit job.
- Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.

1916
02:20:44,978 --> 02:20:47,891
- Open it.
- 'Fraid I can't do that.

1917
02:20:49,942 --> 02:20:52,274
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, you did.

1918
02:20:53,403 --> 02:20:55,690
What's going on?

1919
02:20:55,781 --> 02:20:59,240
- Looks like we got a vigilante in
our midst. - Shoot him in the face!

1920
02:20:59,326 --> 02:21:03,035
I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't
the first time I've had a gun pointed at me.

1921
02:21:03,121 --> 02:21:06,559
- If you don't take your hand off' that case,
it'll be your last. - Stop causing problems!

1922
02:21:06,583 --> 02:21:09,383
You'll get us all killed! Give 'em
what you got and get 'em outta here!

1923
02:21:09,461 --> 02:21:13,671
Shut the fuck up, fat man! This ain't
none of your goddamn business!

1924
02:21:13,757 --> 02:21:15,998
Be cool, honey bunny, be cool.

1925
02:21:16,093 --> 02:21:18,130
No problem.
I got it under control.

1926
02:21:19,763 --> 02:21:21,754
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

1927
02:21:23,350 --> 02:21:27,264
If you don't open that case, I'm
gonna unload in your fucking face.

1928
02:21:31,692 --> 02:21:33,603
We clear?

1929
02:21:36,780 --> 02:21:38,691
One.

1930
02:21:40,534 --> 02:21:43,026
Two.

1931
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:45,157
Three.
Okay, Ringo.

1932
02:21:45,247 --> 02:21:47,329
You win.

1933
02:21:47,416 --> 02:21:49,327
It's yours.

1934
02:21:53,380 --> 02:21:56,122
Open it.

1935
02:21:59,970 --> 02:22:02,177
Hey, what is it?

1936
02:22:02,264 --> 02:22:04,596
What is it?

1937
02:22:04,683 --> 02:22:07,266
Is that what I think it is?

1938
02:22:07,352 --> 02:22:10,060
Mm-hmm.

1939
02:22:11,648 --> 02:22:13,730
It's beautiful.

1940
02:22:13,817 --> 02:22:16,354
Goddamn it, what is it?

1941
02:22:17,863 --> 02:22:20,776
You let him go!
You let him go!

1942
02:22:20,866 --> 02:22:23,779
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!
- Tell that bitch to be cool.

1943
02:22:23,910 --> 02:22:26,823
Say, “Bitch, be cool!” Say, “Bitch,
be cool!” Be cool! Be cool!

1944
02:22:26,913 --> 02:22:29,575
- Tell that bitch to chill!
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!

1945
02:22:29,708 --> 02:22:32,575
Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
Chill out, honey bunny!

1946
02:22:32,669 --> 02:22:34,410
- Let go of him!
- Chill out, honey bunny!

1947
02:22:34,546 --> 02:22:37,413
Now, promise her it's gonna be all right!
I promise!

1948
02:22:37,549 --> 02:22:39,381
Tell her to chill!
Chill out, honey bunny!

1949
02:22:39,509 --> 02:22:41,420
Now tell me her name.
Yolanda.

1950
02:22:41,511 --> 02:22:44,924
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we?

1951
02:22:45,015 --> 02:22:47,928
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

1952
02:22:48,018 --> 02:22:51,477
We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?

1953
02:22:51,605 --> 02:22:55,223
Come on, Yolanda! What's Fonzie like?
He's cool.

1954
02:22:55,358 --> 02:22:57,224
What?
Cool.

1955
02:22:57,319 --> 02:23:00,152
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

1956
02:23:00,238 --> 02:23:02,149
We're gonna be cool.

1957
02:23:02,240 --> 02:23:07,110
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

1958
02:23:07,204 --> 02:23:09,286
And when I count three,

1959
02:23:09,372 --> 02:23:12,285
I want you to
let go of your gun,

1960
02:23:12,375 --> 02:23:15,868
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

1961
02:23:16,922 --> 02:23:18,959
And when you do it,

1962
02:23:19,049 --> 02:23:21,131
you do it cool.

1963
02:23:21,218 --> 02:23:23,505
You ready?

1964
02:23:23,595 --> 02:23:25,677
One.

1965
02:23:25,764 --> 02:23:27,971
Two,

1966
02:23:28,058 --> 02:23:29,969
three.

1967
02:23:36,942 --> 02:23:40,060
Okay, now you let him go!
Yolanda!

1968
02:23:40,153 --> 02:23:43,737
I thought you were gonna be cool. Now,
when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.

1969
02:23:43,824 --> 02:23:45,906
When I get nervous,
I get scared.

1970
02:23:45,992 --> 02:23:49,781
When motherfuckers get scared, that's
when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.

1971
02:23:51,456 --> 02:23:55,074
Just know,
you hurt him, you die.

1972
02:23:55,168 --> 02:23:58,536
Well, that seems to be
the situation.

1973
02:23:58,630 --> 02:24:00,541
But I don't want that.

1974
02:24:00,632 --> 02:24:02,543
And you don't want that.

1975
02:24:02,634 --> 02:24:05,342
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

1976
02:24:05,428 --> 02:24:07,544
So let's see what we can do.

1977
02:24:09,933 --> 02:24:13,176
Now...
here's the situation.

1978
02:24:13,270 --> 02:24:17,104
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

1979
02:24:17,190 --> 02:24:20,603
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period,

1980
02:24:20,694 --> 02:24:23,607
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

1981
02:24:23,697 --> 02:24:27,611
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

1982
02:24:27,701 --> 02:24:30,614
Besides, I been through too much
shit over this case this morning...

1983
02:24:30,704 --> 02:24:33,617
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

1984
02:24:33,707 --> 02:24:35,493
Vincent!

1985
02:24:35,625 --> 02:24:38,538
Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
Get back!

1986
02:24:38,628 --> 02:24:41,290
It's cool!
We still just talkin'.

1987
02:24:41,423 --> 02:24:44,836
Come on. Point the gun at me. Point
the gun at me.

1988
02:24:44,926 --> 02:24:47,714
There you go.
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

1989
02:24:47,804 --> 02:24:49,715
and don't do a goddamn thing.

1990
02:24:49,806 --> 02:24:51,672
Tell her it's still cool.

1991
02:24:51,808 --> 02:24:54,675
It's still cool, honey bunny.
How we doin', baby?

1992
02:24:56,146 --> 02:24:58,763
I- I gotta go pee.

1993
02:24:58,857 --> 02:25:00,768
I wanna go home.

1994
02:25:00,859 --> 02:25:04,443
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringds proud of you.

1995
02:25:04,529 --> 02:25:07,442
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

1996
02:25:07,532 --> 02:25:10,820
- I'm proud of you, honey bunny.
- I love you.

1997
02:25:10,952 --> 02:25:14,115
I love you too, honey bunny.
Now,

1998
02:25:14,206 --> 02:25:18,165
I want you to go in that
bag and find my wallet.

1999
02:25:20,670 --> 02:25:24,629
Which one is it? It's the one
that says “bad motherfucker.”

2000
02:25:38,897 --> 02:25:41,434
That's it. That's my
bad motherfucker.

2001
02:25:41,524 --> 02:25:44,642
Open it up.
Take out the money.

2002
02:25:49,658 --> 02:25:51,865
Count it.

2003
02:25:58,166 --> 02:26:00,703
How much is there?

2004
02:26:02,587 --> 02:26:04,498
About 1,500 dollars.

2005
02:26:04,589 --> 02:26:07,752
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

2006
02:26:07,842 --> 02:26:11,051
Now, with the rest of those
wallets and the register,

2007
02:26:11,137 --> 02:26:13,257
that makes this a pretty
successful little score, huh?

2008
02:26:13,306 --> 02:26:17,174
Jules, you give that fuckin' Nimrod 1,500
dollars, and I'll shoot him on general principle.

2009
02:26:17,269 --> 02:26:20,682
No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!

2010
02:26:20,772 --> 02:26:22,809
Vince, shut the fuck up!

2011
02:26:22,941 --> 02:26:26,809
Shut up! Come on, Yolanda.
Stay with me, baby.

2012
02:26:26,903 --> 02:26:29,816
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.

2013
02:26:29,906 --> 02:26:31,772
I'm buyin' something
for my money.

2014
02:26:33,076 --> 02:26:36,239
Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?
What?

2015
02:26:36,329 --> 02:26:41,039
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

2016
02:26:41,126 --> 02:26:43,788
You read the Bible, Ringo?

2017
02:26:44,921 --> 02:26:46,832
Not regularly, no.

2018
02:26:46,923 --> 02:26:49,290
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

2019
02:26:49,384 --> 02:26:52,922
Ezekiel 25:17.

2020
02:26:53,013 --> 02:26:55,846
“The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

2021
02:26:55,932 --> 02:26:57,843
“by the inequities of the selfish...

2022
02:26:57,934 --> 02:26:59,800
“and the tyranny of evil men.

2023
02:26:59,894 --> 02:27:03,262
“Blessed is he who, in the name of charity
and good will,

2024
02:27:03,356 --> 02:27:05,768
“shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

2025
02:27:05,859 --> 02:27:09,944
“for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

2026
02:27:10,030 --> 02:27:14,319
“And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

2027
02:27:14,409 --> 02:27:17,447
“those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers.

2028
02:27:17,537 --> 02:27:20,529
“And you will know
I am the Lord...

2029
02:27:20,623 --> 02:27:24,161
when I lay my vengeance
upon you.”

2030
02:27:25,295 --> 02:27:27,707
I been sayin' that shit
for years,

2031
02:27:27,797 --> 02:27:30,915
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2032
02:27:31,009 --> 02:27:33,922
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2033
02:27:34,012 --> 02:27:36,925
I just thought it was some cold blooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

2034
02:27:37,015 --> 02:27:39,427
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

2035
02:27:39,517 --> 02:27:42,930
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2036
02:27:43,021 --> 02:27:45,934
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...

2037
02:27:46,024 --> 02:27:50,894
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,

2038
02:27:50,987 --> 02:27:53,900
and Mr. 9-millimetre here,
he's the shepherd...

2039
02:27:53,990 --> 02:27:57,528
protecting my righteous ass
in the Valley of Darkness.

2040
02:27:57,619 --> 02:27:59,530
Or it could mean...

2041
02:27:59,621 --> 02:28:03,034
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,

2042
02:28:03,124 --> 02:28:07,038
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2043
02:28:07,128 --> 02:28:09,369
Yeah, I'd like that.

2044
02:28:09,464 --> 02:28:12,331
But that shit ain't the truth.

2045
02:28:12,425 --> 02:28:14,291
The truth is,

2046
02:28:15,345 --> 02:28:17,302
you're the weak...

2047
02:28:18,681 --> 02:28:22,049
and I'm the tyranny of evil men.

2048
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:25,431
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2049
02:28:26,689 --> 02:28:29,602
I'm tryin' real hard...

2050
02:28:29,692 --> 02:28:31,979
to be the shepherd.

2051
02:28:47,293 --> 02:28:49,204
Go.

2052
02:29:06,896 --> 02:29:09,263
I think we should be
leaving now.

2053
02:29:09,399 --> 02:29:12,357
♪♪Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

2054
02:29:18,616 --> 02:29:22,575
♪♪
