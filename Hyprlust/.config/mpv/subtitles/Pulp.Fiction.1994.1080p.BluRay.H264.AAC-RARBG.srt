2
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,500
Forget it. It's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit.

3
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,040
You always say that.
The same thing every time.

4
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,040
"I'm through, never
again, too dangerous."

5
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,380
I know that's what I always
say. I'm always right too.

6
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,090
- You forget about it in a day or two.
- The days of me forgetting are over.

7
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,970
The days of me
remembering have just begun.

8
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,470
You know, when you go on
like this, what you sound like?

9
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,430
- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
- You sound like a duck.

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,970
Quack, quack, quack.

11
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,200
Take heart, 'cause you're
never gonna have to hear it again.

12
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,690
Since I'm never gonna do it again,
you're never gonna have to hear me quack.

13
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,020
- After tonight?
- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

14
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,400
- Can I get anyone more coffee?
- Oh, yes!

15
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,780
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,830
I mean, the way it is now, you're takin'
the same risk as when you rob a bank.

17
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,960
Takin' more of a
risk. Banks are easier.

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,840
Federal banks ain't supposed to
stop you in any way during a robbery.

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,190
They're insured. Why
should they give a fuck?

20
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,340
I don't even need a
gun in a federal bank.

21
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,720
Heard about this one bloke, he
walks into a bank with a portable phone.

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,850
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says...

23
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,680
"We got this guy's
little girl. If you don't

24
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,570
give him all your money,
we're gonna kill her."

25
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,440
- Did it work?
- Fuckin' right it worked.

26
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,190
That's what I'm talkin' about. Knucklehead
walks into a bank with a telephone...

27
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,360
not a pistol, not a
shotgun, a fuckin' phone.

28
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,820
Cleans the place out.
They don't lift a fuckin' finger.

29
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,030
Did they hurt the little girl?

30
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,830
There probably never was a little girl.
The point of the story isn't a little girl.

31
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,870
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,920
- You want to rob banks?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,480
I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be
easier than what we've been doing.

34
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,840
No more liquor stores?

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,670
What've we been talkin' about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,200
Besides, it ain't the
giggle it used to be.

37
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,780
There's too many
foreigners own liquor stores.

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,050
Vietnamese, Koreans, don't
even speak fuckin' English.

39
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,530
You tell 'em empty out the register,
they don't know what you're talkin' about.

40
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,060
They make it too personal.

41
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,120
We keep on, one of these gook
fuckers gonna make us kill him.

42
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,770
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.
- I don't want to kill anybody either.

43
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,820
But they'll probably put us in a
situation where it's us or them.

44
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,440
And if it's not the gooks...

45
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,610
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've
owned the store for 15 fucking generations.

46
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,030
You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the
counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.

47
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,100
Try walkin' into one of those
places with nothing but a phone.

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,040
See how far that
gets you. Forget it.

49
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,040
- We're out of it.
- Well, what then, day jobs?

50
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,170
- Not in this life.
- What then?

51
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,510
<i>Garcon, coffee!</i>

52
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,260
This place.

53
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,220
Garcon means boy.

54
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,350
This place? A coffee shop?

55
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,020
What's wrong with that?

56
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,150
Nobody ever robs
restaurants. Why not?

57
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,530
Bars, liquor stores...

58
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,320
gas stations; You get your head
blown off stickin' up one of them.

59
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,830
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.

60
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,290
They're not expectin' to get
robbed. Not as expectin' anyway.

61
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,330
I bet you could cut down on
the hero factor in a place like this.

62
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,420
Correct.

63
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,760
Same as banks, these
places are insured.

64
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,170
Manager. He don't give a fuck.

65
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,100
They're just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin' the diners.

66
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,140
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way
they're takin' a bullet for the register.

67
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,140
Busboys. Some wetback
gettin' paid $1 .50 an hour...

68
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,730
really give a fuck you're
stealin' from the owner?

69
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,960
Customers sittin' there with food in their
mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.

70
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,670
One minute, they're
havin' a Denver omelet...

71
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,650
the next, someone is
stickin' a gun in their face.

72
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,780
See, I got the idea the last liquor
store we stuck up, remember?

73
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,540
- All the customers kept comin' in.
- Yeah.

74
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,460
You got the idea of takin' their
wallets. Now, that was a good idea.

75
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,750
Thank you.

76
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,980
Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,300
- Yes, we did.
- A lot of people come to restaurants.

78
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,960
A lot of wallets.

79
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,050
Pretty smart, huh?

80
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,140
Pretty smart.

81
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,680
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

82
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:25,270
- Come on.
- All right. Same as last time, remember?

83
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,110
You're crowd control.
I'll handle the employees.

84
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,530
- I love you, pumpkin.
- I love you, honey bunny.

85
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,200
Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!

86
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,160
Any of you fucking
pricks move...

87
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,040
and I'll execute every
motherfuckin' last one of you.

Okay, so tell me again
about the hash bars.

97
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,640
Okay, what you want to know?

98
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,850
Hash is legal there, right?

99
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,580
Yeah, it's legal, but
it ain't 100% legal.

100
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,230
You just can't walk into a restaurant,
roll a joint and start puffin' away.

101
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,650
I mean, they want you to smoke in
your home or certain designated places.

102
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,360
- Those are hash bars?
- Yeah. It breaks down like this.

103
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,780
It's legal to buy it.
It's legal to own it.

104
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,040
And if you're the proprietor of
a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.

105
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,540
It's illegal to carry it, but that doesn't
matter, 'cause get a load of this.

106
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,040
If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam,
it's illegal for them to search you.

107
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,460
I mean, that's a right the
cops in Amsterdam don't have.

108
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,140
Oh, man! I'm goin'.
That's all there is to it.

109
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,180
I'm fuckin' goin'.

110
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,340
I know, baby.
You'd dig it the most.

111
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,840
But you know what the
funniest thing about Europe is?

112
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,140
- What?
- It's the little differences.

113
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,540
I mean, they got the same shit
over there that they got here...

114
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,020
but it's just there,
it's a little different.

115
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,560
Example.

116
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,320
You can walk into a movie theater
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

117
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,030
And I don't mean just like no paper
cup. I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.

118
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,990
And in Paris, you can
buy a beer in McDonald's.

119
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,500
You know what they call a Quarter
Pounder with Cheese in Paris?

120
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,750
They don't call it a Quarter
Pounder with Cheese?

121
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,690
They got the metric system. They wouldn't
know what the fuck a quarter-pounder is.

122
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,590
- What do they call it?
- They call it a Royale with Cheese.

123
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,590
- Royale with Cheese.
- That's right.

124
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,130
What do they call a Big Mac?

125
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,510
Big Mac's a Big Mac,
but they call it Le Big Mac.

126
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,180
Le Big Mac.

127
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,310
What do they call a Whopper?

128
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,810
I don't know. I didn't
go into Burger King.

129
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,580
You know what they put on french
fries in Holland instead of ketchup?

130
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,610
What?

131
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,530
- Mayonnaise.
- Goddamn!

132
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,240
I seen 'em do it, man. They
fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.

133
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,900
Yuck.

134
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,490
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

135
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,620
- How many up there?
- Three or four.

136
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,300
- That's countin' our guy?
- Not sure.

137
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,960
So that means that it could
be up to five guys up there?

138
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,220
- It's possible.
- We should have fuckin' shotguns.

139
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,930
- What's her name?
- Mia.

140
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:14,180
- Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?
- I don't know.

141
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,850
However people meet people.
She used to be a actress.

142
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,440
Oh, really? She do
anything I'd have seen?

143
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,190
I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.

144
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,940
Pilot? What's a pilot?

145
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,530
- Well, you know the shows on TV?
- I don't watch TV.

146
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,990
Yeah, but you are aware that there
is an invention called television...

147
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,330
and on this invention
they show shows, right?

148
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,410
Yeah.

149
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,880
The way they pick TV shows is they
make one show. That show's called a pilot.

150
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,590
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

151
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,880
and on the strength of that one show,
they decide if they wanna make more shows.

152
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,590
Some get chosen and become television
programs. Some don't, become nothin'.

153
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,760
She starred in one of the
ones that became nothing.

154
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,600
You remember Antwan Rockamora?

155
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,520
Half-black, half-Samoan. Used
to call him ' "Tony Rocky Horror."

156
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,060
Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?

157
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,030
I wouldn't go so far as
to call the brother fat.

158
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,870
He got a weight problem. I mean,
what's a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.

159
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,990
I think I know who you
mean. What about him?

160
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,370
Marsellus fucked him up good.

161
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,700
Word 'round the campfire is it was
on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.

162
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,880
- So what he'd do? Fuck her?
- No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.

163
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,470
- Well, then what then?
- He gave her a foot massage.

164
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,020
A foot massage? That's it?

165
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,270
Then what'd Marsellus do?

166
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,520
Sent a couple cats over to his
place. They took him out on his patio.

167
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,530
Threw his ass over the
balcony. Nigger fell four stories.

168
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,660
He had a little garden down at the bottom
enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.

169
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,990
Nigger fell through that.

170
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,990
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.

171
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,080
That's a damn shame.

172
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,960
But still, you play with
matches, you get burned.

173
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,550
What do you mean?

174
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,930
You don't be givin' Marsellus
Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

175
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,470
You don't think he overreacted?

176
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,960
Antwan didn't expect
Marsellus to react the

177
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,440
way he did, but he
had to expect a reaction.

178
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,650
It was a foot massage. A foot massage is
nothin'. I give my mother a foot massage.

179
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,280
It's laying your hands in a familiar
way on Marsellus's new wife.

180
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,960
I mean, is it as bad
as eatin' her pussy out?

181
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,240
No, but it's the
same fuckin' ballpark.

182
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,820
Stop right there.

183
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,440
Eatin' the bitch out
and givin' the bitch a

184
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,140
foot massage ain't even
the same fucking thing.

185
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,080
- It's not. It's the same ballpark.
- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.

186
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,080
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine.

187
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,920
But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking
your tongue in the holiest of holies...

188
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,120
ain't the same fuckin'
ballpark; It ain't the

189
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,260
same league; It ain't
the same fuckin' sport.

190
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,220
- Foot massages don't mean shit!
- Have you ever given a foot massage?

191
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,810
Don't be tellin' me about foot
massages. I'm the foot fuckin' master.

192
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,390
You given a lot of them?

193
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,400
Shit, yeah! Got my technique down and
everything. I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.

194
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,860
Would you give a
guy a foot massage?

195
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,150
Fuck you.

196
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,410
- You give 'em a lot?
- Fuck you.

197
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,200
You know, I'm kind of tired.
I could use a foot massage.

198
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,160
Yo, yo, yo, man. You best back
off. I'm gettin' a little pissed here.

199
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,170
- This is the door.
- Yeah, it is.

200
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,970
What time you got?

201
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,260
7:22 in the a.m.

202
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,930
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

203
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,230
Now, look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no
man a foot massage don't make it right...

204
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,730
for Marsellus to
throw Antwan off a

205
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,530
building into a glass
motherfuckin' house...

206
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,320
fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks; That shit ain't right.

207
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,360
Motherfucker do that
shit to me, he better

208
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,620
paralyze my ass, 'cause
I kill the motherfucker.

209
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,200
I ain't sayin' it's right,
but you sayin' a foot

210
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,670
massage don't mean
nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.

211
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,150
Now, look, I've given
a million ladies a million

212
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,380
foot massages, and
they all meant somethin'.

213
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,170
We act like they don't, but they do.
That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.

214
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,340
There's a sensuous
thing goin' on...

215
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,640
where you don't talk about it,
but you know it and she knows it.

216
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,770
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan
should've fuckin' better known better.

217
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,230
That's his fuckin' wife, man. This ain't a
man with a sense of humor about this shit.

218
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,940
You know what I'm sayin'?

219
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,110
It's an interestin' point.

220
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,150
Come on. Let's
get into character.

221
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,080
- What's her name again?
- Mia.

222
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,170
- Mia.
- Why you so interested in big man's wife?

223
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,900
He's goin' out of town,
Florida. And he asked

224
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,460
me if I'd take care of
her while he's gone.

225
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,510
- Take care of her?
- No, man. Just take her out.

226
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,930
Show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.

227
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,560
You're gonna be takin'
Mia Wallace out on a date?

228
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,270
It is not a date.

229
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,440
It's just like if you were gonna take
your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.

230
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,730
It's just good
company, that's all.

231
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,740
It's not a date. It's
definitely not a date.

232
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:34,040
Hey, kids. How you boys doin'?

233
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,800
Hey, keep chillin'.

234
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,760
You know who we are?

235
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,810
We're associates of your
business partner, Marsellus Wallace.

236
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,900
You do remember your
business partner, don't you?

237
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,360
Now, let me take
a wild guess here.

238
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,620
- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.

239
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,450
I thought so.

240
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,160
You remember your business partner
Marsellus Wallace, don't ya, Brett?

241
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,670
Yeah, I remember.

242
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,040
Good. Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

243
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,760
Sorry about that.
Whatcha havin'?

244
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,800
Hamburgers.

245
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,970
Hamburgers! The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.

246
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,390
What kind of hamburgers?

247
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,430
- Cheeseburgers.
- No, no, no.

248
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,600
Where'd you get 'em? McDonald's,
Wendy's, Jack in the Box?

249
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,480
- Where?
- Big Kahuna Burger.

250
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,690
Big Kahuna Burger! That's
that Hawaiian burger joint.

251
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,740
I hear they got some tasty burgers. I
ain't never had one myself. How are they?

252
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,950
- They're good.
- You mind if I try one of yours?

253
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,660
- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.

254
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,970
This is a tasty burger! Vincent!

255
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,600
You ever had a
Big Kahuna burger?

256
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,100
- Want a bite? They're real tasty.
- I ain't hungry.

257
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,600
Well, if you like burgers,
give 'em a try sometime.

258
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:18,520
Me, I can't usually get 'em
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian...

259
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,740
which pretty much
makes me a vegetarian.

260
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,360
But I do love the
taste of a good burger.

261
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,030
You know what they call a Quarter
Pounder with Cheese in France?

262
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,700
- No.
- Tell 'em, Vincent.

263
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,790
- A Royale with Cheese.
- A Royale with Cheese.

264
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,830
You know why they call it that?

265
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,510
Because of the metric system?

266
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,840
Check out the
big brain on Brett!

267
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,310
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.

268
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,730
- What's in this?
- Sprite.

269
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,140
Sprite. Good.

270
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,690
You mind if I have some of your
tasty beverage to wash this down with?

271
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,940
Go right ahead.

272
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,540
That hit the spot.

273
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,040
You. Flock of Seagulls.
You know why we're here?

274
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,360
Why don't you tell my man Vince
here where you got the shit hid at.

275
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,630
It's over...

276
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,340
I don't remember askin'
you a goddamned thing!

277
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,810
You were sayin'?

278
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,940
It's in the cupboard.

279
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,150
No, the one by your knees.

280
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,090
We happy?

281
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,800
Vincent?

282
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,600
- We happy?
- Yeah, we happy.

283
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,930
Look, I'm sorry. I
didn't get your name.

284
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,190
I got yours. Vincent.
Right? But I never got yours.

285
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,980
My name's Pitt, and your ass
ain't talkin' your way outta this shit.

286
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,610
No, no, no.

287
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,530
I just want you to know how...

288
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,160
I just want you to know how sorry
we are that things got so fucked up...

289
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,410
with us and Mr. Wallace.

290
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,000
We got into this thing with the
best intentions. Really. I never-

291
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,460
Oh, I'm sorry, did I
break your concentration?

292
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,130
I didn't mean to
do that. Please.

293
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:55,430
Continue. You were saying
something about ""best intentions."

294
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:00,690
What's the matter?
Oh, you were finished!

295
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,480
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

296
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,030
What does Marsellus
Wallace look like?

297
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,320
What?

298
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,620
- What country you from?
- What?

299
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,500
"What" ain't no country I ever
heard of. They speak English in What?

300
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,960
What?

301
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,750
- English, Motherfucker! Do you speak it?
- Yes!

302
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,500
- Then you know what I'm sayin'!
- Yes.

303
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,000
Describe what Marsellus
Wallace looks like!

304
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,720
- What? I... Say ' "what" again!

305
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,720
Say "what" again! I dare ya! I
double dare you, motherfucker!

306
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,680
- Say ""what" one more goddamn time!
- He's black.

307
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,100
- Go on!
- He's bald!

308
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,900
- Does he look like a bitch?
- What?

309
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,650
Does he look... like a bitch?

310
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,740
No!

311
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,950
Then why you tryin' to
fuck him like a bitch, Brett?

312
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,660
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett!

313
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,910
- You tried to fuck him.
- No, no.

314
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,250
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

315
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,380
- You read the Bible, Brett?
- Yes!

316
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,010
Well, there's this passage I got
memorized. Sort of fits this occasion.

317
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,430
Ezekiel 25:17.

318
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,800
"The path of the
righteous man..."

319
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,810
is beset on all sides by
the inequities of the selfish...

320
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,810
and the tyranny of evil men.

321
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,820
Blessed is he who, in the
name of charity and goodwill...

322
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,030
shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness...

323
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,780
for he is truly his
brother's keeper...

324
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,410
and the finder of lost children.

325
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:45,330
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

326
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:50,050
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers!

327
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,970
And you will know
my name is the Lord...

328
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,430
"when I lay my
vengeance upon thee!"

329
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:20,370
I think you gonna find, when
all this shit is over and done...

330
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,250
I think you're gonna find
yourself one smilin' motherfucker.

331
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,170
The thing is, Butch...

332
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,590
right now... you got ability.

333
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,640
But painful as it may
be, ability... don't last.

334
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,230
And your days
are just about over.

335
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,150
Now, that's a hard
motherfuckin' fact of life.

336
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:56,280
But that's a fact of life your ass is
gonna have to get realistic about.

337
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,660
You see, this business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

338
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine.

339
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:14,420
If you mean it turns
to Vinegar... it does.

340
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:19,470
If you mean it gets
better with age... it don't.

341
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,100
Besides, Butch...

342
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,930
how many fights you think
you got in you anyway?

343
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,560
Two?

344
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,070
Boxers don't have
an old-timers' day.

345
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,870
You came close,
but you never made it.

346
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,620
And if you were gonna make it,
you would have made it before now.

347
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,600
You my nigger?

348
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,810
Certainly appears so.

349
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,490
The night of the fight,
you may feel a slight sting.

350
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,580
That's pride fuckin' with you.

351
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,250
Fuck pride!

352
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,250
Pride only hurts.

353
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,510
It never helps.

354
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,970
You fight through that shit.

355
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:50,350
'Cause a year from now, when
you kickin' it in the Caribbean...

356
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,940
you gonna say to yourself,
"Marsellus Wallace was right."

357
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,440
I got no problem
with that, Mr. Wallace.

358
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:05,570
In the fifth, your
ass goes down.

359
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,000
Say it.

360
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,080
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

361
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,710
Yo, Vincent Vega.
Our man in Amsterdam.

362
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,260
Jules Winfield, our man in
Inglewood. Get your asses on in here.

363
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,600
Goddamn, nigger, what's
up with them clothes?

364
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,180
You don't even want to know.

365
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,520
Where's the big man?

366
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,350
The big man's right over there
takin' care of some business.

367
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,820
Why don't you hang
back a second or two. You

368
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,070
see the white boy
leave, just go on over.

369
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,030
How ya been?

370
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,200
I been doin' pretty
good. How 'bout yourself?

371
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,030
All right.

372
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,500
So I hear you're takin'
Mia out tomorrow.

373
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,380
At Marsellus's request.

374
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,670
- Have you met Mia?
- Not yet.

375
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,930
What's so fuckin' funny?

376
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,600
- Not a goddamn thing.
- I got to piss.

377
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,930
Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot,
all right? It's the big man's wife.

378
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,690
I'm gonna sit across from her,
chew my food with my mouth closed...

379
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,730
laugh at her fuckin'
jokes, and that's it.

380
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,940
Hey, my name's Paul,
and this shit's between y'all.

381
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:25,820
Then what'd you fuckin'
ask me about it for? Asshole.

382
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,080
- Gimme a pack of Red Apples.
- Filters?

383
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,580
No.

384
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,340
- You lookin' at somethin', friend?
- You ain't my friend, palooka.

385
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:50,430
- What was that?
- I think you heard me just fine, punchy.

386
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,100
Vincent Vega's in the house?

387
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,140
My nigger, get
your ass over here.

388
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,820
- What's up?
- Man, I'm really sorry.

389
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,070
You shouldn't worry about it.

390
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,120
Pack of Red Apples. $1 .40.

391
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,160
And some matches.

392
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,500
Thanks.

393
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,170
It's as if it turns every part of
your body into the tip of a penis.

394
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,550
I'll lend it to you. It's a
great book on piercing.

395
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,640
That gun to pierce your ears, they don't
use that to pierce your nipples, do they?

396
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:40,560
Forget that gun. That guns goes
against the entire idea behind piercing.

397
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:45,530
All my piercing, 18 places on my body,
every one of 'em done with a needle.

398
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:49,070
Five in each ear, one through
the nipple of my left breast...

399
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,280
two in my right nostril,
one in my left eyebrow...

400
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,200
one in my belly, one in
my lip, one in my clit...

401
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:58,750
- and I wear a stud in my tongue.
- Excuse me.

402
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,750
I was just curious...

403
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:04,710
but... why would you
wear a stud in your tongue?

404
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,260
Sex thing. Helps fellatio.

405
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,840
Vincenzo. Step in my office.

406
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,150
This is Panda from
Mexico. Very good stuff.

407
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,650
Now, that's Bava.
Different, but equally good.

408
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:28,650
And that is Choco from the
Harz Mountains of Germany.

409
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,160
Now, the first two are the same.
300 a gram. Those are friend prices.

410
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,200
But this one is a
little more expensive.

411
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,660
This is 500 a gram.

412
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:42,120
But, when you shoot it, you will
know where that extra money went.

413
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:46,290
There's nothing wrong with these
two. This is real, real, real good shit.

414
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,960
But this one is a
fuckin' madman.

415
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,880
Remember, I just got
back from Amsterdam.

416
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,970
Am I a nigger? Are
we in Inglewood? No.

417
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,220
You're in my home. Now, white
people who know the difference...

418
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,270
between good shit and bad shit,
this is the house they come to.

419
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,730
Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi
Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...

420
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:09,110
- any old day of the fuckin' week.
- That's a bold statement.

421
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,030
This ain't Amsterdam,
Vince. This is a seller's market.

422
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:17,120
Coke is fuckin' dead as... dead.

423
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,040
Heroin, it's comin'
back in a big fuckin' way.

424
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,790
- All right. Gimme three grams of madman.
- Okay.

425
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,300
Now, if it's as good as you say it is, I'll
come back and buy another thousand.

426
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,130
I just hope that I still
have some left for ya...

427
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,390
but I'm givin' you some
out of my own private stash.

428
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,390
That is what a nice guy I am.

429
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,520
I'm outta balloons.
Is a baggie all right?

430
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,810
Yeah, that's cool.

431
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,850
All right. I'll just
get one for ya.

432
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:50,860
Honey, will you get me some
baggies and twistix from the kitchen?

433
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,530
Okay.

434
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:55,990
Hey, what do you think about
Trudi? She ain't got a boyfriend.

435
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,870
- You wanna hang out and get high?
- Which one's Trudi?

436
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:04,120
- The one with all the shit in her face?
- No, that's Jody.

437
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,080
That's my wife.

438
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,300
- I'm sorry, man.
- Thank you.

439
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,970
- No, I can't. I gotta be someplace.
- All right, no problemo

440
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,800
I'll take a rain check.

441
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,430
Thank you, Jody.

442
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,680
Still got your Malibu?

443
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,980
Oh, man, you know what
some fucker did the other day?

444
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,980
- What?
- Fuckin' keyed it.

445
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:33,650
- Oh, man, that's fucked up.
- Tell me about it.

446
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,400
I had it in storage
for three years.

447
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:40,830
It was out five days, and some
dickless piece of shit fucked with it.

448
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:45,330
They should be fuckin' killed, man.
No trial, no jury, straight to execution.

449
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:50,130
I wish I could've caught him doin' it. I'd
have given anything to catch that asshole.

450
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,210
It'd been worth him doin' it
just so I could've caught him.

451
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,920
What a fucker!

452
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,800
What's more chicken-shit than
fuckin' with a man's automobile?

453
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,760
- Don't fuck with another man's Vehicle.
- You don't do it.

454
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,220
- It's just against the rules.
- Thank you.

455
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,810
Thank you.

456
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,350

This is Jackrabbit Slim's.

Fantastic job, Rick.
Thank you very much.

What do you think?

539
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:46,790
I think it's like a wax
museum with a pulse.

540
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,840
Hi, I'm Buddy.
What can I get you?

541
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,140
Let's see, steak, steak, steak. Oh,
yeah, I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

542
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,720
I'll have that.

543
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:02,470
How do you want that cooked?
Burned to a crisp or bloody as hell?

544
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,730
Bloody as hell, and-Oh,
yeah, look at this-Vanilla coke.

545
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,230
What about you, Peggy Sue?

546
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:16,110
I'll have the... Durward
Kirby burger, bloody.

547
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,990
And... a five-dollar shake.

548
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,790
How do you want that shake,
Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy?

549
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:28,040
- Martin and Lewis.
- Did you just order a five-dollar shake?

550
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,250
That's a shake? That's
milk and ice cream?

551
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,300
Last I heard.

552
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,840
That's five dollars? You don't
put bourbon in it or nothin'?

553
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,260
- No.
- Just checking.

554
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,010

Marsellus said you just
got back from Amsterdam.

565
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,340
- Sure did.
- How long were you there?

566
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,970
Just over three years.

567
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,310
I go there about once a
year to chill out for a month.

568
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,610
No kiddin'? I didn't know that.

569
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,150
Why would you?

570
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,320
I heard you did a pilot.

571
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,080
That was my 15 minutes.

572
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,700
What was it?

573
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:51,460
It was a show about a team of female
secret agents called Fox Force Five.

574
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,250
- What?
<i>- Fox Force Five.</i>

575
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,590
Fox, as in were a
bunch of foxy chicks.

576
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,130
Force, as in we're a
force to be reckoned with.

577
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,970
And five, as in there's
one-two-three-four-five of us.

578
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,760
There was a blond one, Sommerset
O'Neal. She was the leader.

579
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:08,930
The Japanese fox
was a Kung Fu master.

580
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:13,110
The black girl was
a demolition expert.

581
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:16,020
French Fox's specialty was sex.

582
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,690
What was your specialty?

583
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,860
Knives.

584
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,570
The character I
played, Raven McCoy...

585
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,490
her background was she grew
up raised by circus performers.

586
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:30,830
According to the show, she was the
deadliest woman in the world with a knife.

587
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,670
And she knew a
zillion old jokes.

588
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:37,880
Her grandfather, an old
vaudevillian, taught her.

589
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,260
And if we would have got picked up,
they would've worked in a gimmick...

590
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:45,220
where every show I
would've told another joke.

591
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,180
You know any of them old jokes?

592
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:52,980
Well, I only got the chance to say
one 'cause we only did one show.

593
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,610
- Tell me.
- It's corny.

594
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,610
Don't be that way. Tell me.

595
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,240
No, you wouldn't like it,
and I'd be embarrassed.

596
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:06,370
You'd be embarr-You told 50
million people, and you can't tell me?

597
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:10,330
- I promise I won't laugh.
- That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.

598
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,710
That's not what I
meant. You know it.

599
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:16,210
Now I'm definitely not gonna tell
you 'cause it's been built up too much.

600
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,000
What a gyp.

601
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,420
Martin and Lewis.

602
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,890
Vanilla coke.

603
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,560
Yummy.

604
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,610
You think I could
have a sip of that?

605
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,320
Be my guest.

606
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,030
I gotta know what a
five-dollar shake tastes like.

607
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,530
You can use my straw.
I don't have cooties.

608
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:51,410
- Yeah, but maybe I do.
- Cooties I can handle.

609
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,460
All right.

610
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,800
Goddamn, that's a pretty
fuckin' good milk shake!

611
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,880
Told ya.

612
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:08,970
I don't know if it was worth five
dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' good.

613
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,670
Don't you hate that?

614
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,430
Hate what?

615
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,850
Uncomfortable silences.

616
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:56,350
Why do we feel it's necessary to yak
about bullshit in order to be comfortable?

617
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,650
I don't know. That's
a good question.

618
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,190
That's when you know you
found somebody really special.

619
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,950
When you can just shut the fuck up for
a minute and comfortably share silence.

620
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,830
Well, I don't think
we're quite there yet,

621
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:13,700
but don't feel bad.
We just met each other.

622
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,250
I'll tell you what.

623
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:22,090
I'm gonna go to the
bathroom and powder my nose.

624
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:25,380
You sit here... and
think of something to say.

625
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,010
I'll do that.

626
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,850
Okay.

627
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,250
I said goddamn!

628
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:03,500
Goddamn! Goddamn.

629
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,710
I need some hair spray.

630
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,910
Don't you just love it when you
come back from the bathroom...

631
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,940
to find your food
waiting for you?

632
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,230
We're lucky we
got anything at all.

633
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,690
I don't think Buddy
Holly's much of a waiter.

634
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,820
Maybe we should've sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section.

635
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,950
- Which one? There's two Monroes.
- No, there's not.

636
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,990
That is Marilyn Monroe.

637
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,160
That is Mamie Van Doren.

638
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:43,170
I don't see Jayne Mansfield,
so she must have the night off.

639
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:46,670
- Pretty smart.
- Yeah. I got my moments.

640
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,550
So did you think
of somethin' to say?

641
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,630
Actually, I did.

642
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,220
However...

643
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:59,430
you seem like a really
nice person, and I...

644
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,020
I don't want to offend you.

645
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,230
This doesn't sound
like the usual, mindless,

646
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,610
boring,
gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.

647
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:10,110
This sounds like you
actually have somethin' to say.

648
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:12,650
Well, well, I do. I do.

649
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,130
But you have to promise
not to be offended.

650
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:17,740
No, no.

651
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:21,910
You can't promise somethin' like that. I
have no idea what you're gonna ask me.

652
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,870
You can ask me what
you're gonna ask me...

653
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,420
and my natural response
could be to get offended.

654
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,420
Then through no fault of my own,
I would have broken my promise.

655
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:32,170
- Let's just forget it.
- That's an impossibility.

656
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:36,300
Trying to forget anything as intriguing
as this would be an exercise in futility.

657
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,600
- Is that a fact?
- And besides...

658
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,100
isn't it more exciting when
you don't have permission?

659
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:43,690
All right, all right.

660
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,690
Well, here goes.

661
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,650
What did you think about
what happened to Antwan?

662
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:53,150
- Who's Antwan?
- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

663
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,740
He fell out of a window.

664
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:58,410
Well, that is one way to say it.

665
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:01,240
Another way to say it would
be that he was thrown out.

666
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:04,460
Another way would be he
was thrown out by Marsellus.

667
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,120
Yet, even another way...

668
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:09,670
is to say he was thrown out of a
window by Marsellus because of you.

669
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:12,170
- Is that a fact?
- No.

670
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:14,240
No, it's not a fact.
It's just what I heard.

671
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,380
That's just what I heard.

672
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:17,970
- Who told you?
- They.

673
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:20,890
"They" talk a lot, don't they?

674
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,730
They certainly do.
They certainly do.

675
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:27,810
Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did ""they" say?

676
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,560
I'm not shy.

677
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,820
Did it involve the ' "F" word?

678
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,910
No, no, no, no, no. They just said that
Antwan had given you a foot massage.

679
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:41,660
- And?
- And nothin'. That's it.

680
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:48,330
You heard Marsellus threw Tony Rocky
Horror out of a fourth-story window...

681
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,000
for giving me a foot massage?

682
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,590
And you believe that?

683
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:57,180
Well, at the time I was
told it sounded reasonable.

684
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:00,350
Marsellus throwing Tony
out of a fourth-story window...

685
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:02,810
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

686
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:06,230
No, it seemed excessive, but
that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

687
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:09,770
I understand that Marsellus
is very protective of you.

688
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:14,440
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

689
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:18,280
A husband almost killing another man for
touching his wife's feet is something else.

690
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,370
But did it happen?

691
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:25,870
Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was
my hand when he shook it... at my wedding.

692
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:28,290
Really?

693
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:31,880
Truth is, nobody knows why
Marsellus threw Tony out that window...

694
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,840
except Marsellus and Tony.

695
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,130
When you little scamps get together,
you're worse than a sewing circle.

696
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:42,760
Ladies and gentlemen. Now the
moment you've all been waiting for.

697
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:47,480
The world-famous
Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.

698
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:54,610
Now, this is where
one lucky couple...

699
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:59,150
will win this handsome trophy
that Marilyn here is holding.

700
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,780
Now, who will be
our first contestants?

701
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:05,160
- Right here!
- All right!

702
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,250
- I wanna dance.
- No, no, no, no, no.

703
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:13,040
No, no, no, no, no. I do believe
Marsellus, my husband, your boss...

704
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,050
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

705
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:20,300
Now I wanna dance; I
wanna win; I want that trophy.

706
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,970
- So dance good.
- All right. You asked for it.

707
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,890
Let's hear it for
our first contestants.

708
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,100
Now let's meet our first
contestants here this evening.

709
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:35,770
Young lady, what is your name?

710
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,940
Mrs. Mia Wallace.

711
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:40,650

712
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,450
Vincent Vega.

713
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:46,080
All right, let's see what
you can do. Take it away!

714
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,410

Whether or not you
can maintain loyalty.

00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:37,570
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:40,360
You fu-Oh, Jesus Christ!

788
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:42,740
Oh, fuck me. Fuck me!

789
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:46,700
Oh-Come on, girl. We're gettin'
outta here. We gotta walk now.

Answer.

793
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:14,070
<i>Have you got the ring?</i>

794
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:17,990
<i>- Why, certainly.
- Join hands, you two lovebirds.</i>

795
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:20,450
<i>Please! Please!</i>

796
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:23,200
<i>Yes, yes. Hold
hands, you lovebirds.</i>

797
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,670
Fuck you, Lance! Answer!

798
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:38,630
<i>Now what do you say?</i>

799
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,470
<i>I give up! I'll marry you!</i>

800
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,390
Lance! The goddamn
phone's ringing!

801
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,770
I can hear it.

802
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:53,020
I thought you told those fuckin'
assholes never to call here this late!

803
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:54,610
Yeah, I told them.

804
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:57,940
And that is exactly what I'm going
to tell this fucking asshole right now.

805
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:03,240
<i>- Don't you dare strike me!</i>
- Hello.

806
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,620
Lance! Vincent.

807
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,580
I'm in big fuckin' trouble,
man. I'm coming to your house.

808
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,750
Hold your horses, man.
What's the problem?

809
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:14,850
I got this chick, she's
fuckin' O.D.in' on me!

810
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,090
Well, don't bring her here!

811
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:18,130
I'm not even joking with you!

812
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:20,510
Do not be bringing some
fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!

813
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:22,630
- No choice.
- She's O.D.in'?

814
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,930
- She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!
<i>- Just dandy.</i>

815
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:30,180
Okay, then you bite the fuckin' bullet,
take her to a hospital and call a lawyer.

816
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:32,690
- Negative!
- This is not my fuckin' problem, man!

817
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:35,480
You fucked her up,
you fuckin' deal with this!

818
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:39,400
Are you talkin' to me
on a cellular phone?

819
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,900
I don't know you. Who
is this? Don't come here!

820
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:44,160
I'm hanging up the phone!
Prank caller! Prank caller!

821
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,330
What the hell was that?

822
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,070
Have you lost your
fucking mind? You were

823
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:02,010
talking about drug
shit on a cellular phone!

824
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:03,720
Lance, help me.

825
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,590
You crashed your car
into my fucking house!

826
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,240
Grab her feet.

827
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,220
Are you deaf? You are not bringing
this fucked-up bitch into my house!

828
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:12,730
This "fucked-up bitch" is
Marsellus Wallace's wife.

829
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:14,850
- Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is?
- Yeah.

830
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:17,730
If she croaks on me, I
am a fucking grease spot!

831
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:23,400
I will be forced to tell him that you did
not help and let her die on your lawn.

832
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:25,950
Now, come on, help
me, help me. Pick her up.

833
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:28,950
Shit.

834
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,870
Lance!

835
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,370
Shit.

836
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,380
It's 1:30 in the
goddamn morning.

837
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,540
What the fuck's
going on out here?

838
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,760
Who's she?

839
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,760
Go to the fridge and get the
thing with the adrenaline shot.

840
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,890
- What's wrong with her?
- She's O.D.ing!

841
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:51,060
- Get her outta here!
- Get the shot!

842
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:54,640
- Fuck you! Fuck you too!
- What a fuckin' bitch.

843
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:56,270
Just keep talking
to her, all right?

844
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:59,210
She's gettin' the shot. I'm going to
go get my little black medical book.

845
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:01,230
What the fuck you
need a medical book for?

846
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,730
I've never had to give
an adrenaline shot before!

847
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:07,240
I don't go joy-poppin' with bubble-gummers!
My friends can handle their highs!

848
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,740
- Get the shot!
- I am, if you'll let me!

849
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:12,300
- I ain't stopping you!
- Stop talking to me. Start talking to her!

850
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:14,250
- Get the shot!
- All right!

851
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,420
- Hurry up. We're losing her!
- I'm looking as fast as I can!

852
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,960
What's he looking for?

853
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:26,340
- I don't know. Some book.
- What are you looking for?

854
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:28,840
- A little black medical book.
- What are you looking for?

855
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:33,510
My little black medical book! It's
like a textbook they give to nurses.

856
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,520
- I never saw no medical book.
- Trust me. I have one.

857
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,890
If it's so important, why
don't you keep it with the shot?

858
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,560
I don't know! Stop bothering me!

859
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:43,270
While you're looking, that
girl's gonna die on our carpet.

860
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,090
You're never gonna
find anything in this mess!

861
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:47,280
I'm gonna fucking kill
you if you don't shut up!

862
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,490
Lance, get in here!

863
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:52,070
- Right?
- Get the fuck outta my way.

864
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,780
Pig.

865
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:56,040
Quit fuckin' around
and give her the shot.

866
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,210
While I'm doing this, you take
off her shirt and find her heart.

867
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:02,330
- Does it gotta be exact?
- Yeah, it's gotta be exact.

868
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,650
We're giving her a shot in
the heart, so it's gotta be exact.

869
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:06,900
I don't know exactly where
her heart is. I think it's right here.

870
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,420
- That's it.
- This it?

871
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:11,090
All right, what I need is
a big, fat magic marker.

872
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,100
- You got it?
- What?

873
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:15,850
A magic marker. A felt pen!

874
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:18,560
A fuckin' black
magic marker! Christ.

875
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,450
Come on, man. Hurry up!

876
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,730
Fuck! Okay, okay.
Okay. I think it's ready.

877
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,360
- Hurry up, man.
- I'll tell you what to do.

878
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:32,370
- You're gonna give her the shot.
- No, you're gonna give her the shot.

879
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:34,430
I ain't giving her the shot.
I never done this before.

880
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:36,410
I never done this
either! I ain't starting now!

881
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,330
You brought her here.
You give her the shot.

882
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:40,980
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch to
your house, then I give her the shot.

883
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,920
- Give her the shot.
- Give it to me. Give me that.

884
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,920
All right, tell me what to do.

885
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:50,510
Okay, you're giving her an injection
of adrenaline straight to her heart.

886
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:52,970
But she's got a breastplate-
you gotta pierce through that.

887
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:56,010
You gotta bring the needle
down in a stabbing motion.

888
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:59,520
- I gotta stab her three times?
- No, just stab her once!

889
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:03,020
But it's gotta be hard enough to get
through her breastplate into her heart.

890
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:06,020
Once you do that, you
press down on the plunger.

891
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:08,570
- Okay. Then what happens?
- Kinda curious about that myself.

892
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:11,570
This ain't no fuckin'
joke! Am I gonna kill her?

893
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,580
She's supposed to
come out of it like that. It's-

894
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:15,070
All right, count to three.

895
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,330
- All right. Ready?
- One.

896
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,170
Two.

897
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:33,470
Three!

898
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:51,990
If you're all right,
then say something.

899
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,570
Something.

900
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:57,410
That was fuckin' trippy.

901
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:02,000
- Ohh.
- Oh, man.

902
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:29,610
Mia. Mia.

903
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:33,190
What's-

904
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:38,700
What's your thoughts
on-on-on how to handle this?

905
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,200
What's yours?

906
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:48,540
Well, I'm of the opinion that if
Marsellus lived his whole life...

907
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:51,090
he doesn't need to know
nothing about this incident.

908
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:57,260
If Marsellus knew about this incident,
I'd be in as much trouble as you.

909
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,220
I seriously doubt that.

910
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:02,560
I can keep a secret if you can.

911
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:06,390
Shake on it?

912
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:14,320
Mum's the word?

913
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,360
Cool.

914
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:19,870
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going
to go home and have a heart attack.

915
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:24,410
Vincent.

916
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:30,290
Do you wanna hear
my Fox Force Five joke?

917
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,590
Sure.

918
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:36,380
Except I think I'm still a
little too petrified to laugh.

919
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:39,390
No, you won't laugh
'cause it's not funny.

920
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:41,800
But if you still wanna
hear it, I'll tell it.

921
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,100
- I can't wait.
- Okay.

922
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,520
Three tomatoes are
walkin' down the street.

923
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,020
Papa Tomato, Mama
Tomato and Baby Tomato.

924
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:54,730
Baby Tomato starts lagging behind,
and Papa Tomato gets really angry.

925
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:58,860
Goes back and squishes
him and says, "'Ketchup."

926
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,200
Ketchup.

927
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:10,460
See you around.

928
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:35,730
<i>Oh, that paddlefoot.
He funny, silly dog.</i>

929
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:38,820
<i>He think totem pole alive!</i>

930
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,610
<i>He Arctic tenderfoot!</i>

931
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:45,740
<i>That totem pole
been here forever!</i>

932
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:47,290
Butch?

933
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:50,210
<i>One more thing,
and we'll start for-</i>

934
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:53,210
- Butch, stop watching TV for a second.
- Yeah?

935
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:56,920
- You've got a special Visitor.
<i>- Stand up. Stand up.</i>

936
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:03,390
Now, do you remember when I told
you your daddy died in a POW camp?

937
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:08,430
Well, this here
is Captain Koons.

938
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,640
He was in the POW
camp with Daddy.

939
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:21,860
Hello, little man. Boy, I sure
heard a bunch about you.

940
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:25,370
See, I was a good
friend of your dad's.

941
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:30,830
We were in that Hanoi pit of
hell together, over five years.

942
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:33,250
Hopefully...

943
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:36,540
you'll never have to
experience this yourself...

944
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:40,300
but when two men are in a
situation like me and your dad were...

945
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:43,180
for as long as we were...

946
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:46,180
you take on certain
responsibilities of the other.

947
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,260
If it'd been me who'd...

948
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:57,230
not made it, Major Coolidge'd
be talking right now to my son Jim.

949
01:04:58,110 --> 01:05:00,900
But the way it turned
out, I'm talking to you.

950
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,740
Butch...

951
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:07,320
I got something for ya.

952
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:16,330
This watch I got here...

953
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:18,190
was first purchased by your

954
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:21,170
great-grandfather during
the First World War.

955
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:25,680
It was bought in a little general
store in Knoxville, Tennessee.

956
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:29,560
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

957
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,390
Up 'til then, people just
carried pocket watches.

958
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,810
It was bought by private
Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

959
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:38,690
on the day he
set sail for Paris.

960
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:41,070
This was your
great-grandfather's war watch...

961
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:44,740
and he wore it every day
he was in that war, and...

962
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:48,370
when he'd done his duty, he went
home to your great-grandmother...

963
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:52,870
took the watch off, put it in an old
coffee can, and in that can it stayed...

964
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:57,170
until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,
was called upon by his country...

965
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:01,170
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

966
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:03,340
This time they
called it World War II.

967
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,800
Your great-grandfather gave this
watch to your granddad for good luck.

968
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:12,850
Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

969
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:15,850
Dane was a Marine,
and he was killed...

970
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:18,650
along with all the other Marines
at the battle of Wake Island.

971
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,980
Your granddad was facing death.

972
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:24,740
He knew it.

973
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:28,950
None of those boys had any illusions
about ever leaving that island alive...

974
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:32,240
so three days before the
Japanese took the island...

975
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:37,540
your granddad asked a gunner on an
Air Force transport, name of Winocki...

976
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:40,540
a man he'd never
met before in his life...

977
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:43,590
to deliver to his infant son...

978
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:48,260
who he'd never seen in
the flesh, his gold watch.

979
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:52,680
Three days later, your granddad
was dead, but Winocki kept his word.

980
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:56,980
After the war was over, he
paid a visit to your grandmother...

981
01:06:57,060 --> 01:07:01,310
delivering to your infant
father his dad's gold watch.

982
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,320
This watch.

983
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:14,620
This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.

984
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:18,120
He was captured, put in a
Vietnamese prison camp.

985
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:22,250
He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch...

986
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:25,130
it'd be confiscated, taken away.

987
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,630
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

988
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,520
He'd be damned if any
slope's gonna put their

989
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:33,430
greasy, yellow hands
on his boy's birthright...

990
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:37,640
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something-his ass.

991
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:41,140
Five long years he wore
this watch up his ass.

992
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:45,400
Then he died of dysentery-
He give me the watch.

993
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:49,320
I hid this uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass two years.

994
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,320
Then...

995
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:55,490
after seven years, I was
sent home to my family and...

996
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:56,990
now...

997
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:02,880
little man, I give
the watch to you.

998
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:27,650
It's time, Butch.

999
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:38,330
<i>In the lightweight division...</i>

1000
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:41,540
<i>in the right corner
wearing the blue trunks...</i>

1001
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:44,880
<i>weighing 210 pounds...</i>

1002
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,130
<i>Floyd Ray Wilson!</i>

1003
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:53,680
<i>It's official. It's
official. Wilson is dead!</i>

1004
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,590
<i>Well, Dan, that had
to be the bloodiest...</i>

1005
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:58,100
<i>and hands down, the most
brutal fight this city's ever seen.</i>

1006
01:08:58,180 --> 01:08:59,830
<i>Coolidge was out of
there faster than I've</i>

1007
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,580
<i>ever seen a Victorious
boxer leave the ring.</i>

1008
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,270
<i>- Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?
- My guess would be yes.</i>

1009
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:08,770
<i>I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way
to the realization of what he was doing.</i>

1010
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:10,780
<i>I think any man would've
left the ring that fast.</i>

1011
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:13,780
<i>Do you feel this tragedy is
gonna affect the world of boxing?</i>

1012
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:15,720
<i>A tragedy like this
can't help but shake</i>

1013
01:09:15,730 --> 01:09:17,780
<i>the world of boxing
to its very foundations.</i>

1014
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:19,700
<i>It's of paramount
importance, during the</i>

1015
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:21,750
<i>sad weeks ahead, the
eyes of the WBA remain-</i>

1016
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,450
Man, you know I didn't-.

1017
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:02,450
- Marsellus.
- No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.

1018
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:04,450
I didn't do it.

1019
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:07,040
- How you doing?
- Great.

1020
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:09,040
I never thanked you for dinner.

1021
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:13,380
- What you got?
- He booked.

1022
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:14,260
His trainer?

1023
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:16,800
Says he don't know
nothin'. I believe him.

1024
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,850
I think Butch surprised
his ass same as us.

1025
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:20,050
No, we don't wanna think.

1026
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:23,720
We wanna know. Take him to
the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.

1027
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:26,640
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

1028
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:28,520
Butch's search-how
do you want it done?

1029
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:31,900
I'm prepared to scour the
Earth for that motherfucker.

1030
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:35,240
If Butch goes to Indochina, I want
a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...

1031
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:40,070
- ready to pop a cap in his ass.
- I will take care of it.

1032
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,290
Mister.

1033
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:57,670
- Hey, mister.
- What?

1034
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:02,550
You were in that fight,
the fight on the radio.

1035
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,100
- You're the fighter?
- Whatever gave you that idea?

1036
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:08,890
No, come on.

1037
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:10,940
You're him.

1038
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:13,440
I know you're him.

1039
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:17,070
Tell me you're him.

1040
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:19,070
I'm him.

1041
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,280
You killed the other boxing man.

1042
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:28,330
He's dead?

1043
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:30,830
The radio said he was dead.

1044
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:35,840
Sorry about that, Floyd.

1045
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:39,630
What does it feel like?

1046
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,640
What does what feel like?

1047
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,220
Killing a man.

1048
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:49,480
Beating another man to
death with your bare hands.

1049
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:51,650
What are you, a weirdo?

1050
01:11:51,730 --> 01:11:56,320
No. It is a subject I
have much interest in.

1051
01:11:58,570 --> 01:12:02,240
You are the first person I have
ever met who has killed somebody.

1052
01:12:04,990 --> 01:12:06,450
So?

1053
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,290
What does it feel
like to kill a man?

1054
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:13,500
I'll tell you what.

1055
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:17,050
Give me one of them cigarettes you got
up there and I'll tell you all about it.

1056
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,780
So, Esmarelda...

1057
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:43,490
Villa Lobos-is that Mexican?

1058
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:46,780
The name is Spanish,
but I am Colombian.

1059
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:50,120
- That's some handle you got there, honey.
- Thank you.

1060
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,160
And what is your name?

1061
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:55,790
Butch.

1062
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:57,880
What does it mean?

1063
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:00,460
I'm an American, honey.
Our names don't mean shit.

1064
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:06,010
So, moving right
along, Esmarelda...

1065
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,390
what is it you want to know?

1066
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:11,900
I want to know what it
feels like to kill a man.

1067
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:13,350
I couldn't tell ya.

1068
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:21,940
I didn't know he was dead
'til you told me he was dead.

1069
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:26,570
Now that I know he's dead, you
wanna know how I feel about it?

1070
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,580
I don't feel the
least bit bad about it.

1071
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:48,260
What the fuck'd I tell ya?

1072
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:52,890
As soon as the word got out the fix was
in, man, the odds went through the roof.

1073
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:55,190
I know. I know. Unbelievable.

1074
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:58,690
Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was
a better boxer, he'd still be alive.

1075
01:13:58,770 --> 01:14:00,230
If he never laced
up his gloves...

1076
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:03,320
which he never shoulda done in the
first fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.

1077
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:08,870
Yeah, well, who gives
a fuck? It's over now.

1078
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:11,620
Yeah, well, enough about
the poor, unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1079
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:14,370
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1080
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:17,620
How many bookies
did you lay it around on?

1081
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:21,250
All eight? How long to collect?

1082
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,720
So you'll have it all by
tomorrow night? No, I understand.

1083
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,930
A few stragglers aside. Oh,
fuck, Scotty, that is good news.

1084
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:31,220
That is great news, man.

1085
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:34,720
Yeah. No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1086
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,850
It'll probably take us a couple
days to get down to Knoxville.

1087
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:40,650
Okay, my brother.

1088
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:44,280
You're right. You're
goddamn right.

1089
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,860
All right, Scotty, next time I see
you, it'll be on Tennessee time.

1090
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:50,450
Cool, brother.

1091
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:08,340
$45.60.

1092
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:17,140
And... here's a little
something for the effort.

1093
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:21,770
Now... if anybody asks you who your
fare was tonight, what are you gonna say?

1094
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:23,270
The truth.

1095
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:27,150
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1096
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:31,610
Bonsoir, Esmarelda Villa Lobos.

1097
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:34,240
<i>Buenas noches, Butch.</i>

1098
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:47,260
Whew.

1099
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:50,630
Keep the light off.

1100
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,680
- Is that better, sugar pop?
<i>- Oui.</i>

1101
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:00,060
Hard day at the office?

1102
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:02,060
Pretty hard.

1103
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:03,770
Got in a fight.

1104
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,610
Poor baby.

1105
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:09,240
Can you make spoons?

1106
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,400
You know what? I was
thinkin' about takin' a shower.

1107
01:16:11,490 --> 01:16:15,240
- I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.
- I like the way you stink.

1108
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:18,240
Let me take this jacket off.

1109
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:24,460
- I was looking at myself in the mirror.
- Uh-huh.

1110
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:26,460
I wish I had a pot.

1111
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:31,260
You were looking at yourself in the
mirror and you wish you had some pot?

1112
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:34,390
A pot. A pot belly.

1113
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:37,390
Pot bellies are sexy.

1114
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:39,770
Well, you should be happy...

1115
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,190
'cause you have one.

1116
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:45,310
Shut up, fatso. I
don't have a pot.

1117
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:49,230
I have a bit of a tummy, like
Madonna when she did "'Lucky Star."

1118
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,030
It's not the same thing.

1119
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:54,240
I didn't know there was such a
difference between a pot belly and a tummy.

1120
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,240
The difference is huge.

1121
01:16:58,330 --> 01:17:00,750
Would you like it
if I had a pot belly?

1122
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:02,500
No.

1123
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:06,920
Pot bellies make a man look
either oafish or like a gorilla.

1124
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,420
But on a woman a
pot belly's very sexy.

1125
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:15,930
The rest of you is normal-normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal ass...

1126
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:20,060
but with a big,
perfectly round pot belly.

1127
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:24,850
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small to accentuate it.

1128
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:27,560
You think men would
find that attractive?

1129
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:30,820
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1130
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:34,360
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch and pleasing to the eye...

1131
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:36,360
is seldom the same.

1132
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:43,370
If you had a pot belly,
I would punch you in it.

1133
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:46,370
- You'd punch me in the belly?
- Right in the belly.

1134
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:48,380
Ohh! I'd smother you!

1135
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:52,380
I'd drop it right on your
face 'til you couldn't breathe!

1136
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:54,380
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

1137
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:56,380
- Promise?
- Yeah.

1138
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,900
Did you get everything?

1139
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:14,940
- Yes, I did.
- Good job, sugar pop.

1140
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:16,950
Did everything go as planned?

1141
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:19,780
You didn't listen to the-Ow!

1142
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:21,740
You didn't listen to the radio?

1143
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:25,120
I never listen to your
fights. Were you the winner?

1144
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:27,500
I won, all right.

1145
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:30,540
- Are you still retiring?
- Sure am.

1146
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:33,000
So it all worked
out in the finish.

1147
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:36,220
We're not at the
finish yet, baby.

1148
01:18:45,810 --> 01:18:48,230
We're in a lot of
danger, aren't we?

1149
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:52,690
If they find us, they'll
kill us, won't they?

1150
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:57,200
But they won't
find us, will they?

1151
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,280
Do you still want
me to go with you?

1152
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:09,250
I don't want to be a
burden or a nuisance. It's-

1153
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,380
Say it.

1154
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:22,970
Fabienne, I want
you to be with me.

1155
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:27,180
- Forever?
- Forever and ever.

1156
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:31,270
Do you love me?

1157
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,360
Very, very much.

1158
01:19:39,070 --> 01:19:41,610
- Butch.
- Yes?

1159
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,660
Will you give me oral pleasure?

1160
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,120
Will you kiss it?

1161
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:53,210
But you first.

1162
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:55,630
- Okay.
- Okay.

1163
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:07,600
Butch.

1164
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:30,120
I think I cracked a rib.

1165
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:33,630
- Giving me oral pleasure?
- No, retard, from the fight.

1166
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:37,130
- Don't call me retard.
- My name is Fabby.

1167
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:39,710
- My name is Fabienne!
- Stop it.

1168
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,300
- Stop it!
- My name is Fabi-.

1169
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:44,720
Shut up, fuckhead! I
hate that mongoloid Voice.

1170
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,890
Okay, okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1171
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:49,890
I take it back.

1172
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:55,810
Will you hand me a dry
towel, Miss Beautiful Tulip?

1173
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:59,820
Oh, I like that. I like
being called a tulip.

1174
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:02,320
Tulip is much better
than mongoloid.

1175
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,320
I didn't call you a mongoloid.
I called you a retard.

1176
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:07,530
And I took it back.

1177
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:09,700
Butch?

1178
01:21:09,790 --> 01:21:11,700
Yes, lemon pie?

1179
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:15,210
- Where are we going to go?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.

1180
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:17,420
Wherever you want.

1181
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,420
We're gonna get a
lot of money from this...

1182
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:21,670
but it ain't gonna be
the kind of money...

1183
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:25,090
that we can live like hogs
in the fat house forever.

1184
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:29,930
I was thinking maybe we could go
down someplace in the South Pacific.

1185
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:33,430
Kind of money we're gonna have's
gonna carry us a long way down there.

1186
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:36,440
- If we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?
- You betcha.

1187
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:39,940
And if after a while you didn't dig
that, we could go someplace else.

1188
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:42,440
Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.

1189
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:44,450
But I do not speak Spanish.

1190
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:47,490
Well, you do not speak
Bora-Boran either.

1191
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:49,200
Besides, Mexican's easy.

1192
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:54,540
- What does that mean?
- Where is the shoe store?

1193
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:56,710
Spit, please.

1194
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:01,880
Excellent pronunciation.

1195
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:06,300
You'll be my little
mamacita in no time.

1196
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:12,180
- What time is it?
- What time is it?

1197
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:13,770
Time for bed.

1198
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:16,890
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1199
01:22:24,610 --> 01:22:26,030
Butch?

1200
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:33,870
Never mind.

1201
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:48,130
Merde! You startled me.
Did you have a bad dream?

1202
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,310
What is this you're watching?

1203
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:04,820
A motorcycle movie.
I'm not sure the name.

1204
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:09,820
- Are you watching it?
- In a way.

1205
01:23:12,330 --> 01:23:15,040
It's a little early in the
morning for explosions and war.

1206
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:19,750
What was it about?

1207
01:23:19,830 --> 01:23:23,000
How should I know? You
were the one watching it.

1208
01:23:23,090 --> 01:23:27,090
- No, imbecile, what was your dream about?
- I don't know.

1209
01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:29,090
I don't remember.

1210
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:32,050
It's really rare that I
remember my dreams.

1211
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:34,430
Well, let's look at the
grumpy man in the morning.

1212
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:39,890
Why don't you get up and
we'll get some breakfast.

1213
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:41,690
One more kiss and I'll get up.

1214
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:48,110
- Satisfied?
- Yep.

1215
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:52,320
Get up, lazy bones!

1216
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:54,870
God.

1217
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:59,660
- What time is it?
- Almost 9:00 in the morning.

1218
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:03,500
- What time does our train arrive?
- 11:00.

1219
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:05,930
You know what I'm
gonna have for breakfast?

1220
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:06,940
What, lemon pie?

1221
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:14,140
I'm gonna order a big plate of
blueberry pancakes with maple syrup...

1222
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:17,640
eggs over easy
and five sausages.

1223
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,930
Anything to drink with that?

1224
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:22,400
Wow, that looks nice.

1225
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:29,570
To drink-a tall glass of orange
juice and a black cup of coffee.

1226
01:24:29,650 --> 01:24:32,830
After that, I'm going
to have a slice of pie.

1227
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,200
Pie for breakfast?

1228
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:37,580
Any time of the day
is a good time for pie.

1229
01:24:38,290 --> 01:24:40,750
Blueberry pie to go
with the pancakes.

1230
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:44,290
And on top, a thin
slice of melted cheese.

1231
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:46,290
Where's my watch?

1232
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:53,010
It's there.

1233
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:56,220
- No, it's not.
- Have you looked?

1234
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:59,060
Yes, I've fuckin' looked. What
the fuck do you think I'm doin'?

1235
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,230
You sure you got it?

1236
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:04,600
Yes. Bedside table drawer.

1237
01:25:04,690 --> 01:25:07,820
- On the little kangaroo?
- Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.

1238
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:11,110
Yeah, well, it's not here now.

1239
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:13,990
Well, it should be.

1240
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:17,910
Yes, it most definitely should be, but
it's not here now! So where the fuck is it?

1241
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:26,920
Fabienne, where's my
father's fucking watch?

1242
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:32,130
Do you have any idea what he had
to go through to get me that watch?

1243
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:35,510
I don't have time to go into
it, but he went through a lot.

1244
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:39,180
All this other shit you could've set on
fire, but I specifically reminded you...

1245
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:42,810
not to forget the
fucking watch! Now think.

1246
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:46,400
- Did you get it?
- I believe so.

1247
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:49,770
You believe so? What the fuck does
that mean? You either did or didn't get it.

1248
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:53,110
Then I did.

1249
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:56,360
Are you sure?

1250
01:25:57,990 --> 01:25:59,450
No.

1251
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:03,450
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1252
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:05,870
Motherfucker! Motherfuckin'-.

1253
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:10,590
Do you know how fucking
stupid you fucking are?

1254
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:12,630
No!

1255
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:17,180
It's not your fault.

1256
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:24,430
You left it at the apartment.

1257
01:26:30,190 --> 01:26:32,780
If you left it at the
apartment, it's not your fault.

1258
01:26:35,530 --> 01:26:37,410
I had you bring
a bunch of stuff.

1259
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:42,370
I reminded you about it...

1260
01:26:42,450 --> 01:26:46,250
but I didn't illustrate how
personal the watch was to me.

1261
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:50,630
I fall I gave a fuck about was
the watch, I shoulda told you that.

1262
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:54,210
You're not a mind reader.

1263
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:55,800
Are you?

1264
01:27:07,230 --> 01:27:08,270
I'm sorry.

1265
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:11,940
Don't be. Just means I
can't have breakfast with you.

1266
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:14,730
Why does it mean that?

1267
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:20,610
Because I gotta go back to
my apartment and get my watch.

1268
01:27:21,870 --> 01:27:24,370
Won't the gangsters
be looking for you there?

1269
01:27:24,450 --> 01:27:27,540
Well, that's what
I'm gonna find out.

1270
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:33,040
If they are, and I don't think
I can handle it, then I'll split.

1271
01:27:33,130 --> 01:27:38,420
I saw your watch. I thought
I brought it. I'm so sorry.

1272
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:46,720
Here's some money. Go
out and get those pancakes.

1273
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:48,680
Have a nice breakfast.

1274
01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:51,520
I'll take your Honda. I'll be back
before you can say blueberry pie.

1275
01:27:51,610 --> 01:27:53,110
Blueberry pie.

1276
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:56,900
Maybe not that fast.

1277
01:27:56,990 --> 01:28:00,200
- But pretty fast. Okay?
- Okay.

1278
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:02,570
- Bye.
- Bye.

1279
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:05,240
Shit! Of all the fuckin' things
she could fuckin' forget...

1280
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:07,330
she forgets my father's watch!

1281
01:28:07,410 --> 01:28:09,080
I specifically reminded her-

1282
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,790
Bedside table, on the kangaroo.

1283
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:15,130
I said the words: "Don't
forget my father's watch."

1284
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:34,060
<i>Visit the Jackrabbit

01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:11,630
glad to help. That guy
was a drunken maniac.

1307
01:35:11,710 --> 01:35:14,630
He hit you, then he
crashed into that car.

1308
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:16,590
- Who?
- Him.

1309
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:22,890
I'll be damned.

1310
01:35:39,610 --> 01:35:41,370
I'm shot!

1311
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:49,920
Sally! Sally!

1312
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:00,760
Motherfucker!

1313
01:36:03,430 --> 01:36:06,850
- Can I help you with somethin'?
- Shut the fuck up.

1314
01:36:06,930 --> 01:36:09,850
Now you just wait a
goddamn minute, now!

1315
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:11,900
What the fuck you up to?

1316
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:14,610
Come here, motherfucker!

1317
01:36:14,690 --> 01:36:17,570
You feel that
sting, huh, big boy?

1318
01:36:17,650 --> 01:36:19,570
That's pride fuckin'
with you, see?

1319
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:21,610
You gotta fight
through that shit!

1320
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:26,160
- You'd better kill me... Yeah,
somebody's gonna get killed.

1321
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:28,790
Somebody's gonna get their
motherfuckin' head blown to-.

1322
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:31,370
Hold it right there, goddamn it.

1323
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:35,210
- This ain't none of your business, mister.
- I'm makin' it my business.

1324
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:38,010
- Toss the weapon.
- You don't understand, man.

1325
01:36:38,090 --> 01:36:40,130
Toss the weapon.

1326
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:45,350
<i>It's time.</i>

1327
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:48,140
<i>- To find love</i> - Take
your foot off the nigger.

1328
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:50,140
Put your hand
behind your head...

1329
01:36:50,230 --> 01:36:52,270
approach the counter right now.

1330
01:36:52,350 --> 01:36:55,150
This motherfucker's
trying to kill me.

1331
01:36:55,650 --> 01:36:59,650
Shut up. Keep comin'. Come on.

1332
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:04,660
<i>♪ If love ♪</i>

1333
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:06,660

1334
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:26,300
Zed. Maynard.

1335
01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:30,220
Yeah, the spider just
caught a couple flies.

1336
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:33,770
<i>♪ Whoa, my angel ♪</i>

1337
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:39,480
<i>♪ Down to you ♪</i>

1338
01:38:18,110 --> 01:38:22,070
Nobody kills anybody in my
place of business except me or Zed.

1339
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,990
That's Zed.

1340
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:43,840
- I thought you said you waited for me.
- I did.

1341
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:51,600
Then how come
they're all beat up?

1342
01:38:52,810 --> 01:38:55,890
They did that to each other,
man. They came in fightin'.

1343
01:38:55,980 --> 01:38:58,060
Now, this 'un right here...

1344
01:38:58,150 --> 01:39:01,060
- he was gonna shoot that one.
- Is that right?

1345
01:39:01,150 --> 01:39:03,780
You gonna shoot him, boy?

1346
01:39:08,450 --> 01:39:11,490
Hey, is Grace
all right out front?

1347
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:14,790
- Yeah. It ain't Tuesday, is it?
- No, it's Thursday.

1348
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:16,540
She oughta be fine.

1349
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:23,210
Well, bring out the gimp.

1350
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:27,050
I think the gimp's sleepin'.

1351
01:39:27,130 --> 01:39:29,970
Then I guess you'll just have to
go wake him up now, won't you?

1352
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:12,090
Get up.

1353
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,320
Get down.

1354
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:39,790
Which one of 'em
you wanna do first?

1355
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:43,630
I ain't for sure yet.

1356
01:40:47,670 --> 01:40:50,300
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo...

1357
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:52,970
catch a nigger...

1358
01:40:53,050 --> 01:40:55,640
by his toe.

1359
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:59,470
If he hollers, let him go.

1360
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:03,730
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo.

1361
01:41:06,730 --> 01:41:09,610
My mother said...

1362
01:41:09,690 --> 01:41:13,280
pick the perfect one...

1363
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:16,370
and... you... are...

1364
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:19,740
it.

1365
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:25,130
- Guess that means you, big boy.
- Fuck you!

1366
01:41:29,210 --> 01:41:30,670
You wanna do it in here?

1367
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:34,010
No, let's take him back
to Russell's old room.

1368
01:41:34,090 --> 01:41:36,800
Sounds good to me.

1369
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:02,040
You keep an eye on this 'un.

1370
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:33,820
Yeah!

1371
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:40,030
Now! Go! Come on, motherfucker!

1372
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,830
Now, motherfucker!

1373
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:48,040
Come on! Yeah!

1374
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,340
Yeah!

1375
01:43:04,230 --> 01:43:06,230
- Ohh!
- Yeah!

1376
01:43:09,230 --> 01:43:11,110
Yeah! Yeah!

1377
01:43:13,610 --> 01:43:16,530
Yeee! Yeeee-hah!

1378
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:38,630
Yeah!

1379
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:10,540
Come on! Get down there!

1380
01:44:14,090 --> 01:44:16,420
Do it! Yeah!

1381
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:35,520
Yeah! Yeah!

1382
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:53,080
Shut the fuck up!

1383
01:44:57,210 --> 01:44:58,630
Fuck him!

1384
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:03,260
Come on!

1385
01:45:06,850 --> 01:45:09,810
Fuck him. Yeah.

1386
01:45:41,090 --> 01:45:43,340
You want that
gun, don't ya, Zed?

1387
01:45:47,930 --> 01:45:49,850
Go ahead and pick it up.

1388
01:45:52,270 --> 01:45:54,560
Go ahead, pick it up.

1389
01:45:56,860 --> 01:45:59,360
Come on-Thatta boy!

1390
01:46:00,940 --> 01:46:05,030
I want you to pick it up, Zed.

1391
01:46:09,290 --> 01:46:12,370
Step aside, Butch.

1392
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:26,340
Fuck!

1393
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:31,810
You okay?

1394
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:36,730
No, man.

1395
01:46:37,310 --> 01:46:40,230
I'm pretty fuckin'
far from okay.

1396
01:46:51,410 --> 01:46:52,410
What now?

1397
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:01,420
Let me tell you what now.

1398
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:05,880
I'm gonna call a couple of
hard, pipe-hittin' niggers...

1399
01:47:05,970 --> 01:47:08,640
to go to work on
the homes here...

1400
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:11,430
with a pair of pliers
and a blowtorch.

1401
01:47:13,890 --> 01:47:16,600
You hear me
talkin', hillbilly boy?

1402
01:47:17,850 --> 01:47:20,400
I ain't through with
you by a damn sight!

1403
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:22,940
I'm gonna get
medieval on your ass.

1404
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:29,610
I meant what now
between me and you.

1405
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:36,620
Oh, that what now.

1406
01:47:38,540 --> 01:47:41,250
I tell you what now
between me and you.

1407
01:47:44,050 --> 01:47:46,970
There is no me and you.

1408
01:47:48,430 --> 01:47:50,340
Not no more.

1409
01:47:53,430 --> 01:47:55,350
So, are we cool?

1410
01:47:56,730 --> 01:47:58,390
Yeah, we cool.

1411
01:47:59,730 --> 01:48:01,230
Two things.

1412
01:48:02,980 --> 01:48:05,940
Don't tell nobody about this.

1413
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:11,030
This shit is between me, you...

1414
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:15,580
and Mr. "'Soon-to-be-livin'-the-rest
of-his-short-ass-life-in-agonizing-pain"...

1415
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:17,580
rapist here.

1416
01:48:18,870 --> 01:48:21,620
It ain't nobody else's business.

1417
01:48:21,710 --> 01:48:23,630
Two-.

1418
01:48:23,710 --> 01:48:27,210
You leave town
tonight. Right now.

1419
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:32,180
And when you
gone, you stay gone...

1420
01:48:32,260 --> 01:48:34,180
or you be gone.

1421
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:37,970
You lost all your
LA privileges. Deal?

1422
01:48:40,230 --> 01:48:41,560
Deal.

1423
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:45,360
Get your ass outta here.

1424
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:13,720
Oh, shit.

1425
01:49:47,250 --> 01:49:52,010
Fabienne!

1426
01:49:54,930 --> 01:49:57,010
Fabienne! Come on, baby.

1427
01:49:57,100 --> 01:49:58,970
Come on. Get your shit.
We gotta go right now.

1428
01:49:59,060 --> 01:50:00,680
I was so worried.
What about our bags?

1429
01:50:00,770 --> 01:50:03,080
Fuck the bags; If we don't split
right now, we'll miss the train.

1430
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:06,020
- Come on, I'll be downstairs.
- Is everything well?

1431
01:50:06,110 --> 01:50:09,730
- Just come on! No talking now!
- Are we in danger?

1432
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:14,950
Come on, honey!

1433
01:50:18,030 --> 01:50:19,950
Where did you get
this motorcycle?

1434
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:22,500
It's not a motorcycle, baby.
It's a chopper. Let's go.

1435
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:24,540
What happened to my Honda?

1436
01:50:24,620 --> 01:50:28,380
I'm sorry, baby, I had to crash that
Honda. Will you come on now, please?

1437
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:30,920
Come on, let's
go, let's go, let's go.

1438
01:50:35,430 --> 01:50:36,430
You're hurt?

1439
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:38,890
No, no, I might've broken
my nose. It's no biggie.

1440
01:50:38,970 --> 01:50:41,890
Come on. Hop on.
Baby, please, we-.

1441
01:50:41,970 --> 01:50:44,770
Honey, we gotta hit
the fuckin' road! Get on!

1442
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:50,730
Oh, baby, I'm sorry. Come
here, come here. I'm sorry.

1443
01:50:52,030 --> 01:50:53,530
I'm so sorry.

1444
01:50:53,610 --> 01:50:56,030
You were gone so long, I
started to think dreadful thoughts.

1445
01:50:56,110 --> 01:50:59,030
I didn't mean to worry
you. Everything's fine.

1446
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:01,030
- How was your breakfast?
- It was good.

1447
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:03,040
Did you get the
blueberry pancakes?

1448
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:06,100
They didn't have blueberry; I had to
get buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay?

1449
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:09,040
Since I left you, this has
been, without a doubt...

1450
01:51:09,130 --> 01:51:13,340
the single weirdest fuckin' day
of my life-I'll tell you all about it.

1451
01:51:13,420 --> 01:51:15,210
Gotta go. Come on.

1452
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:18,090
Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

1453
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:20,760
- It's a chopper, baby.
- Whose chopper is this?

1454
01:51:20,850 --> 01:51:22,760
- Zed's.
- Who's Zed?

1455
01:51:22,850 --> 01:51:25,770
Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead.

1456
01:51:41,580 --> 01:51:43,870
Yes, you did, Brett!

1457
01:51:43,950 --> 01:51:47,460
You tried to fuck him, and Marsellus
Wallace don't liked to be fucked...

1458
01:51:47,540 --> 01:51:49,960
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

1459
01:51:50,040 --> 01:51:53,130
- Oh, God, please, I don't wanna die.
- You read the Bible, Brett?

1460
01:51:53,210 --> 01:51:53,600
Yes!

1461
01:51:53,610 --> 01:51:56,630
Well, there's this
passage I got memorized.

1462
01:51:56,720 --> 01:51:58,880
Sorta fits the occasion.

1463
01:51:58,970 --> 01:52:02,260
Ezekiel 25:17.

1464
01:52:02,350 --> 01:52:06,640
"The path of the righteous
man is beset on all sides..."

1465
01:52:06,730 --> 01:52:11,940
by the inequities of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men.

1466
01:52:12,020 --> 01:52:16,860
Blessed is he who, in the
name of charity and good will...

1467
01:52:16,940 --> 01:52:19,990
shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness...

1468
01:52:20,070 --> 01:52:22,570
for he is truly his
brother's keeper...

1469
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:25,370
and the finder of lost children.

1470
01:52:25,450 --> 01:52:31,960
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

1471
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:36,420
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers.

1472
01:52:36,510 --> 01:52:40,340
And you will know
my name is the Lord...

1473
01:52:40,430 --> 01:52:43,800
"when I lay my
vengeance upon thee."

1474
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:54,360
I'm fucked. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1475
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:57,360
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.

1476
01:52:57,440 --> 01:53:00,030
Vincent, Marvin.
Marvin, Vincent.

1477
01:53:00,110 --> 01:53:01,920
Better tell him to shut up.
He's gettin' on my nerves.

1478
01:53:01,950 --> 01:53:04,740
Marvin. Marvin. Marvin!

1479
01:53:04,830 --> 01:53:07,120
I'd knock that shit
off if I was you.

1480
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:10,870
Die, you motherfuckers! Die!

1481
01:53:39,030 --> 01:53:42,450
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?

1482
01:53:42,530 --> 01:53:45,410
Slip your mind? Did you forget
that someone was in there...

1483
01:53:45,490 --> 01:53:47,370
with a goddamn hand cannon?

1484
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:50,660
You see the size of that gun he
fired at us? It was bigger than him.

1485
01:53:56,170 --> 01:53:58,880
We should be fuckin' dead, man.

1486
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:00,880
I know. We was lucky.

1487
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:04,050
No, no, no, no.
That shit wasn't luck.

1488
01:54:04,130 --> 01:54:05,470
Yeah, maybe.

1489
01:54:05,550 --> 01:54:08,350
This was divine intervention.

1490
01:54:08,430 --> 01:54:10,350
You know what
divine intervention is?

1491
01:54:16,230 --> 01:54:18,150
I think so.

1492
01:54:18,230 --> 01:54:21,650
That means that God came down
from heaven and stopped the bullets.

1493
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:24,150
That's right. That's
exactly what it means.

1494
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:27,200
God came down from heaven and
stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.

1495
01:54:28,450 --> 01:54:30,410
I think it's time for
us to leave, Jules.

1496
01:54:30,490 --> 01:54:32,870
Don't do that. Don't
fuckin' blow this shit off!

1497
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:35,040
What just happened
here was a fuckin' miracle!

1498
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:36,920
Chill. This shit happens.

1499
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,750
Wrong! Wrong. This
shit doesn't just happen.

1500
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:43,260
Do you want to continue this
theological discussion in a car...

1501
01:54:43,340 --> 01:54:45,800
or in a jailhouse with the cops?

1502
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:47,550
We should be fuckin'
dead, my friend!

1503
01:54:48,390 --> 01:54:52,770
What happened here was a miracle,
and I want you to fucking acknowledge it!

1504
01:54:52,850 --> 01:54:57,100
All right, it was a
miracle. Can we go now?

1505
01:55:04,570 --> 01:55:07,660
Let's go, nigger! Come on! Shit.

1506
01:55:09,700 --> 01:55:11,660
You ever seen that show Cops?

1507
01:55:11,740 --> 01:55:14,660
I was watching it one time
and there was this cop on...

1508
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:18,670
and he was talkin' about this gunfight
he had in the hallway with this guy, right?

1509
01:55:18,750 --> 01:55:22,170
He just unloaded on this guy and
nothin' happened. He didn't hit nothin'.

1510
01:55:22,250 --> 01:55:24,800
Okay? It was just
him and this guy.

1511
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:28,590
I mean, you know, it's
freaky, but it happens.

1512
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:31,050
You wanna play blind man,
go walk with the shepherd...

1513
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:33,600
but me, my eyes
are wide fuckin' open.

1514
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:35,390
What the fuck does that mean?

1515
01:55:35,480 --> 01:55:36,980
It means that's it for me.

1516
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:39,350
From here on in, you can
consider my ass retired.

1517
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:41,610
- Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.
- Don't blaspheme.

1518
01:55:41,690 --> 01:55:42,720
I said, don't do that!

1519
01:55:42,730 --> 01:55:44,730
Hey, why are you
fuckin' freakin' out on us?

1520
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:47,860
Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus
today-I'm through.

1521
01:55:47,950 --> 01:55:49,910
Why don't you tell him
at the same time why?

1522
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:50,920
Don't worry, I will.

1523
01:55:50,950 --> 01:55:53,270
And I bet you $10,000
he laughs his ass off.

1524
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:54,950
I don't give a damn if he does.

1525
01:55:55,700 --> 01:55:58,120
Marvin, what do
you make of all this?

1526
01:55:58,210 --> 01:56:00,620
Man, I don't even
have an opinion.

1527
01:56:00,710 --> 01:56:04,960
You gotta have an opinion. You think
God came down from heaven and stopped-.

1528
01:56:05,630 --> 01:56:07,210
What the fuck's happenin'?

1529
01:56:07,300 --> 01:56:09,010
- Shit, man!
- Man!

1530
01:56:09,090 --> 01:56:12,010
- Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.
- Why the fuck'd you do that?

1531
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:13,720
I didn't mean it. It
was an accident.

1532
01:56:13,810 --> 01:56:16,270
Man, I seen some crazy-ass
shit in my time, but this-

1533
01:56:16,350 --> 01:56:20,020
Chill out, man! It was an accident. We
probably went over a bump or somethin'.

1534
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:22,020
The car ain't hit no
motherfuckin' bump.

1535
01:56:22,110 --> 01:56:25,400
I didn't mean to shoot the
son of a bitch. The gun went off.

1536
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:28,900
Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on
a city street in broad daylight here!

1537
01:56:28,990 --> 01:56:30,970
- I don't believe it!
- Well, believe it now, motherfucker!

1538
01:56:30,990 --> 01:56:35,450
We gotta get this car off the road. Cops
notice shit like a car drenched in blood.

1539
01:56:35,540 --> 01:56:37,340
Just take it to a
friendly place, that's all!

1540
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:38,510
This is the Valley, Vincent.

1541
01:56:38,540 --> 01:56:40,960
Marsellus ain't got no
friendly places in the Valley.

1542
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:43,130
Well, Jules, this ain't
my fuckin' town, man!

1543
01:56:43,150 --> 01:56:43,460
Shit!

1544
01:56:43,540 --> 01:56:45,960
- What you doing?
- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.

1545
01:56:46,050 --> 01:56:49,550
- Where's Toluca Lake?
- Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.

1546
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:53,090
If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't
know what the fuck we gonna do...

1547
01:56:53,180 --> 01:56:55,600
'cause I ain't got no
other partners in 818.

1548
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:59,600
Jimmie, how you doin', man?
It's Jules. Just listen up, man.

1549
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:03,600
Me and my homeboy are in a car,
and we gotta get it off the road, pronto.

1550
01:57:03,690 --> 01:57:05,860
I need to use your
garage for a couple hours.

1551
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:10,280
We gotta be real fuckin'
delicate with this Jimmie situation.

1552
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:12,990
He's one remark away from
kickin' our asses out the door.

1553
01:57:13,070 --> 01:57:14,490
If he does, what do we do?

1554
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:16,990
We ain't leavin' 'til we
make a couple calls...

1555
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:20,000
but I don't want it to reach
that pitch-Jimmie's a friend.

1556
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:22,270
You don't come into your friend's
house and start tellin' him what's what.

1557
01:57:22,290 --> 01:57:24,500
Just tell him not to be abusive.

1558
01:57:24,580 --> 01:57:27,000
He kinda freaked out back
there when he saw Marvin.

1559
01:57:27,090 --> 01:57:30,260
Put yourself in his position-It's
8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.

1560
01:57:30,340 --> 01:57:32,260
He wasn't expectin' this shit.

1561
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:35,260
We gotta remember here
who's doin' who a favor.

1562
01:57:35,350 --> 01:57:39,180
If that favor means I gotta take shit, he
can stick that favor straight up his ass.

1563
01:57:39,270 --> 01:57:41,680
Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd
you just do to his towel, man?

1564
01:57:41,770 --> 01:57:43,270
I was dryin' my hands!

1565
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:46,270
- You're supposed to wash 'em first!
- You watched me wash 'em.

1566
01:57:46,360 --> 01:57:47,530
I watched you get 'em wet.

1567
01:57:47,540 --> 01:57:49,610
I was washin' 'em.
This shit's hard to get off.

1568
01:57:49,690 --> 01:57:51,900
Maybe if he'd had Lava I
coulda done a better job.

1569
01:57:51,990 --> 01:57:53,900
I used the same
fuckin' soap you did...

1570
01:57:53,990 --> 01:57:56,910
and when I finished, the towel
didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!

1571
01:57:56,990 --> 01:57:59,220
What if he was to come in
here and see his towel like this?

1572
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:02,540
It's shit like this that's gonna
bring this situation to a head, man!

1573
01:58:04,170 --> 01:58:07,590
Look, I ain't threatenin'
you or nothin', all right?

1574
01:58:07,670 --> 01:58:12,130
You know I respect you and all. But just
don't put me in this position, all right?

1575
01:58:12,220 --> 01:58:14,880
All right. Fine. Fine.

1576
01:58:14,970 --> 01:58:17,140
Ask me nice like
that, no problem.

1577
01:58:17,970 --> 01:58:20,930
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

1578
01:58:23,770 --> 01:58:25,520
Goddamn, Jimmie!

1579
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:27,650
This some serious gourmet shit.

1580
01:58:27,730 --> 01:58:31,690
Me and Vincent would've been satisfied
with some freeze-dried Taster's Choice.

1581
01:58:31,780 --> 01:58:36,200
Right? And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.

1582
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:38,820
- What flavor is this?
- Knock it off, Julie.

1583
01:58:38,910 --> 01:58:39,910
What?

1584
01:58:39,950 --> 01:58:42,950
I don't need you to tell me
how fuckin' good my coffee is.

1585
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:45,540
I'm the one who buys
it. I know how good it is.

1586
01:58:45,620 --> 01:58:47,500
When Bonnie goes
shopping, she buys shit.

1587
01:58:47,580 --> 01:58:51,210
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff
'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

1588
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:55,220
But you know what's on my mind right
now? It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.

1589
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:57,470
It's the dead
nigger in my garage.

1590
01:58:57,550 --> 01:58:59,260
Jimmie, don't even worry-

1591
01:58:59,350 --> 01:59:01,450
Don't tell me about anything.
I wanna ask you a question.

1592
01:59:01,470 --> 01:59:02,970
When you came pulling in here...

1593
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:06,290
did you notice the sign on the front of my
house that said, "'Dead nigger storage"?

1594
01:59:06,310 --> 01:59:08,020
You know I ain't seen no-.

1595
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:11,770
Did you notice the sign on the front of
my house that said, "Dead nigger storage"?

1596
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:14,570
No. I didn't.

1597
01:59:14,650 --> 01:59:17,530
- You know why you didn't see that sign?
- Why?

1598
01:59:17,610 --> 01:59:19,770
'Cause it ain't there,
'cause storing dead

1599
01:59:19,780 --> 01:59:22,160
niggers ain't my fuckin'
business, that's why!

1600
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:25,160
- We're not gonna store the motherfucker-
- Don't you fuckin' realize...

1601
01:59:25,250 --> 01:59:29,670
that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead
body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced?

1602
01:59:29,750 --> 01:59:32,960
No marriage counselor. No trial
separation. I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.

1603
01:59:33,050 --> 01:59:36,380
Okay? And I don't
wanna get fuckin' divorced!

1604
01:59:36,470 --> 01:59:41,470
Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,
but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.

1605
01:59:41,550 --> 01:59:43,640
Jimmie, Jimmie, she
ain't gonna leave you.

1606
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:47,640
Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules!
Okay? Don't fuckin' '"Jimmie" me.

1607
01:59:47,730 --> 01:59:49,810
There's nothin' you're
gonna say that's gonna

1608
01:59:49,830 --> 01:59:51,690
make me forget I
love my wife. Is there?

1609
01:59:54,230 --> 01:59:59,490
Now, look, you know, she comes home
from work in about an hour and a half.

1610
01:59:59,570 --> 02:00:02,200
The graveyard
shift at the hospital.

1611
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:05,790
You gotta make some phone
calls? You gotta call some people?

1612
02:00:05,870 --> 02:00:09,790
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck
out of my house before she gets here.

1613
02:00:09,870 --> 02:00:12,710
That's Kool and the Gang. We
don't wanna fuck your shit up.

1614
02:00:12,790 --> 02:00:15,800
All I wanna do is call my
people and get 'em to bring us in.

1615
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:18,800
You're fucking my
shit up right now!

1616
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:21,970
You're gonna fuck my shit up
big time if Bonnie comes home.

1617
02:00:22,050 --> 02:00:25,560
Do me that favor, all right? The phone is
in my bedroom. I suggest you get going.

1618
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:28,560
Well, say she comes home.

1619
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:30,270
What do you think she'll do?

1620
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:34,980
Oh, no fuckin'
shit she'll freak.

1621
02:00:35,070 --> 02:00:37,280
That ain't no kinda answer.

1622
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:40,400
I mean, you know, I don't.
How much? A lot or a little?

1623
02:00:40,490 --> 02:00:45,330
You got to appreciate what an
explosive element this Bonnie situation is.

1624
02:00:45,410 --> 02:00:47,210
<i>She comes home
from a hard day's work, </i>

1625
02:00:47,230 --> 02:00:49,330
<i>finds a bunch of
gangsters in her kitchen...</i>

1626
02:00:49,410 --> 02:00:51,330
<i>doing a bunch
of gangster shit...</i>

1627
02:00:51,420 --> 02:00:54,500
<i>there ain't no tellin'
what she's liable to do.</i>

1628
02:00:56,670 --> 02:00:58,590
Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.

1629
02:00:58,670 --> 02:01:01,260
All I'm doing is
contemplating the ifs.

1630
02:01:01,340 --> 02:01:03,390
I don't wanna hear
about no motherfuckin' ifs!

1631
02:01:03,470 --> 02:01:05,140
All I want to hear
from your ass is...

1632
02:01:05,220 --> 02:01:08,270
"You ain't got no problem,
Jules, I'm on the motherfucker.

1633
02:01:08,350 --> 02:01:12,480
Chill them niggers out and wait for the
cavalry, which should be coming directly."

1634
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:15,730
You ain't got no problem, Jules.

1635
02:01:15,820 --> 02:01:17,940
I'm on the motherfucker.

1636
02:01:18,030 --> 02:01:23,110
Chill them niggers out and wait for
the Wolf, who should be coming directly.

1637
02:01:23,820 --> 02:01:25,570
You sendin' the Wolf?

1638
02:01:25,660 --> 02:01:27,830
Oh, you feel better,
motherfucker?

1639
02:01:27,910 --> 02:01:30,200
Shit, negro!

1640
02:01:30,290 --> 02:01:32,410
That's all you had to say!

1641
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:35,460
She the hysterical type?

1642
02:01:36,750 --> 02:01:38,300
When is she due?

1643
02:01:41,930 --> 02:01:43,840
Give me the
principals' names again.

1644
02:01:43,930 --> 02:01:45,840
Place your bets.

1645
02:01:46,930 --> 02:01:49,310
- Jules.
- Cards, please.

1646
02:01:50,640 --> 02:01:52,600
Vincent.

1647
02:01:57,320 --> 02:01:58,820
Jimmie.

1648
02:02:00,490 --> 02:02:01,860
Bonnie.

1649
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:10,990
It's 30 minutes away.
I'll be there in 10.

1650
02:02:27,970 --> 02:02:30,890
You're... Jimmie, right?
This is your house?

1651
02:02:30,970 --> 02:02:34,600
- It sure is.
- I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.

1652
02:02:34,690 --> 02:02:37,600
- Good. We got one.
- So I heard. May I come in?

1653
02:02:37,690 --> 02:02:39,570
Yeah. Please do.

1654
02:02:39,650 --> 02:02:43,320
You must be Jules. Which
would make you... Vincent.

1655
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:45,820
Let's get down to
brass tacks, gentlemen.

1656
02:02:45,910 --> 02:02:48,680
If I was informed correctly, the
clock is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?

1657
02:02:48,700 --> 02:02:50,160
One hundred percent.

1658
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:53,660
Your wife Bonnie comes home
at 9:30 in the a.m., correct?

1659
02:02:53,750 --> 02:02:54,830
Uh-huh.

1660
02:02:54,910 --> 02:02:57,030
I was led to believe if
she comes home and

1661
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:59,420
finds us here, she
wouldn't appreciate it much.

1662
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:00,960
She wouldn't at that.

1663
02:03:01,050 --> 02:03:03,760
That gives us 40 minutes
to get the fuck outta Dodge...

1664
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:07,300
which, if you do what I say,
when I say it, should be plenty.

1665
02:03:07,390 --> 02:03:11,720
Now, you got a corpse in a car,
minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.

1666
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:21,360
- Jimmie.
- Uh-huh.

1667
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:24,480
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought
I smelled some coffee back there.

1668
02:03:24,570 --> 02:03:28,410
- Would you make me a cup?
- Yeah, sure.

1669
02:03:29,870 --> 02:03:32,780
Oh, how do you take it?

1670
02:03:32,870 --> 02:03:34,410
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1671
02:03:37,790 --> 02:03:40,540
About the car, is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall?

1672
02:03:40,630 --> 02:03:43,920
Does it smoke? Does it make
a lot of noise? Is there gas in it?

1673
02:03:44,010 --> 02:03:47,630
- Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.
- Positive?

1674
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:50,430
Don't get me on the road and I
find out the brake lights don't work.

1675
02:03:50,510 --> 02:03:53,600
As far as I know, the
motherfucker's tip-top.

1676
02:03:53,680 --> 02:03:55,560
Good enough.

1677
02:03:55,640 --> 02:03:57,640
Let's go back to the kitchen.

1678
02:04:03,320 --> 02:04:05,780
- Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
- Thank you, Jimmie.

1679
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:16,200
Okay, first thing. You two.

1680
02:04:16,290 --> 02:04:18,660
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

1681
02:04:18,750 --> 02:04:21,420
Now, Jimmie, this looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1682
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:24,880
That would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit.

1683
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:26,050
Yeah. Under the sink.

1684
02:04:26,130 --> 02:04:29,550
Good. What I need you two fellas to
do is take those cleaning products...

1685
02:04:29,630 --> 02:04:33,640
and clean the inside of the
car-I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1686
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:37,640
Go in the back seat, scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull.

1687
02:04:37,730 --> 02:04:40,140
Get it out of there. Wipe
down the upholstery.

1688
02:04:40,230 --> 02:04:43,650
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1689
02:04:43,730 --> 02:04:45,910
Just give it a good
once-over. What you need

1690
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:48,070
to take care of are
the really messy parts.

1691
02:04:48,150 --> 02:04:52,240
The pools of blood that have
collected, you gotta soak that shit up.

1692
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:54,740
We need to raid
your linen closet.

1693
02:04:54,830 --> 02:04:57,740
I need blankets, I need
comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1694
02:04:57,830 --> 02:05:01,460
The thicker the better, the darker
the better. No whites. Can't use 'em.

1695
02:05:01,540 --> 02:05:06,840
We'll need to camouflage the front
seat and back seat and floorboards...

1696
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:08,840
with quilts and blankets...

1697
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:12,840
so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout
in the car, the subterfuge won't last...

1698
02:05:12,930 --> 02:05:15,760
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1699
02:05:15,850 --> 02:05:17,890
Jimmie, lead the
way. Boys, get to work.

1700
02:05:17,970 --> 02:05:19,730
Please would be nice.

1701
02:05:21,190 --> 02:05:24,190
- Come again?
- I said, a please would be nice.

1702
02:05:26,020 --> 02:05:27,860
Get it straight,
Buster. I'm not here to

1703
02:05:27,870 --> 02:05:29,900
say please. I'm here
to tell you what to do.

1704
02:05:31,700 --> 02:05:33,820
And if self-preservation is
an instinct you possess...

1705
02:05:33,910 --> 02:05:36,620
you'd better fuckin'
do it and do it quick.

1706
02:05:36,700 --> 02:05:41,080
I'm here to help. If my help's not
appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1707
02:05:41,160 --> 02:05:43,960
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;
Your help is definitely appreciated.

1708
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:47,460
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't mean
disrespect, okay? I respect you.

1709
02:05:47,550 --> 02:05:50,380
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

1710
02:05:50,470 --> 02:05:53,470
If I'm curt with you, it's
because time is a factor.

1711
02:05:53,550 --> 02:05:55,720
I think fast, I talk
fast, and I need you

1712
02:05:55,730 --> 02:05:58,180
guys to act fast if you
wanna get out of this.

1713
02:05:58,260 --> 02:06:01,730
So pretty please, with sugar
on top, clean the fuckin' car.

1714
02:06:06,230 --> 02:06:09,360
Don't be lookin' at me like that,
all right? I can feel your look.

1715
02:06:12,610 --> 02:06:15,280
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1716
02:06:17,370 --> 02:06:18,780
Green.

1717
02:06:20,910 --> 02:06:23,080
Nothin' except for
the mess inside.

1718
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:28,460
About 20 minutes.

1719
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:31,920
Nobody who'll be missed.

1720
02:06:33,970 --> 02:06:36,930
You're a good man,
Joe. Thanks a bunch.

1721
02:06:38,010 --> 02:06:41,930
- How we comin', Jimmie?
- Pretty good. I got it all here, but...

1722
02:06:43,270 --> 02:06:44,890
Mr. Wolf, you gotta
understand something.

1723
02:06:44,980 --> 02:06:46,690
Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

1724
02:06:46,770 --> 02:06:50,270
Okay. You gotta understand
something, Winston.

1725
02:06:50,360 --> 02:06:52,280
No, thank you.

1726
02:06:52,360 --> 02:06:55,490
This is our best linen here...

1727
02:06:55,570 --> 02:07:00,660
and it was a wedding present from
my Uncle Conrad and my Aunt Ginny.

1728
02:07:00,740 --> 02:07:03,080
They're not with us
anymore. I wanna help-.

1729
02:07:03,160 --> 02:07:06,750
Let me ask you a
question. If you don't mind.

1730
02:07:06,830 --> 02:07:08,500
No, no, please. Go ahead.

1731
02:07:10,090 --> 02:07:14,970
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt
ginny, were they millionaires?

1732
02:07:16,130 --> 02:07:17,630
No.

1733
02:07:17,720 --> 02:07:20,550
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

1734
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:24,060
And I'm positive that if
Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

1735
02:07:24,140 --> 02:07:26,560
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here...

1736
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:30,900
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set...

1737
02:07:30,980 --> 02:07:34,150
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

1738
02:07:38,110 --> 02:07:42,030
I like oak myself. That's
what I have in my bedroom.

1739
02:07:43,160 --> 02:07:45,120
How about you, Jimmie?

1740
02:07:46,330 --> 02:07:48,290
You an oak man?

1741
02:07:49,380 --> 02:07:51,330
Oak's nice.

1742
02:07:57,180 --> 02:08:01,010
Oh, man, I will never
forgive your ass for this shit.

1743
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:03,510
This is some fucked-up,
repugnant shit.

1744
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:07,020
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits that he is wrong...

1745
02:08:07,100 --> 02:08:10,020
that he is immediately
forgiven for all wrongdoings?

1746
02:08:10,100 --> 02:08:12,520
Get the fuck out my
face with that shit!

1747
02:08:12,610 --> 02:08:14,010
The motherfucker
that said that shit never

1748
02:08:14,020 --> 02:08:15,500
had to pick up itty-bitty
pieces of skull...

1749
02:08:15,530 --> 02:08:16,940
on account of your dumb ass.

1750
02:08:17,030 --> 02:08:19,780
I got a threshold, Jules,
for the abuse that I will take.

1751
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:23,120
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race
car, and you got me in the red.

1752
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:26,950
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1753
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:28,960
That's all. I could blow.

1754
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:30,960
- Oh, you ready to blow?
- Yeah.

1755
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:33,960
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'
motherfucker, motherfucker.

1756
02:08:34,050 --> 02:08:36,960
Every time my fingers
touch brain, I'm Superfly TNT.

1757
02:08:37,050 --> 02:08:38,970
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

1758
02:08:39,050 --> 02:08:41,470
In fact, what the fuck
am I doin' in the back?

1759
02:08:41,550 --> 02:08:45,310
You're the motherfucker should be
on brain detail! We're fuckin' switchin'!

1760
02:08:45,390 --> 02:08:47,850
I'm washin' windows, you're
pickin' up this nigger's skull!

1761
02:08:57,570 --> 02:08:59,530
Fine job, gentlemen.

1762
02:09:00,860 --> 02:09:02,780
You may get out of this yet.

1763
02:09:02,870 --> 02:09:05,280
I can't believe this
is the same car.

1764
02:09:05,370 --> 02:09:09,000
Well, let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.

1765
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:12,620
Phase one is complete-clean the car-
which moves us right along to phase two:

1766
02:09:12,710 --> 02:09:14,790
Clean you two.

1767
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:18,260
Strip.

1768
02:09:18,340 --> 02:09:21,050
- All the way?
- To your bare ass.

1769
02:09:22,180 --> 02:09:25,220
Quickly, gentlemen. We
got about 15 minutes...

1770
02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:28,220
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.

1771
02:09:28,310 --> 02:09:30,810
Goddamn, this morning
air is some chilly shit.

1772
02:09:30,890 --> 02:09:32,810
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

1773
02:09:32,900 --> 02:09:35,310
- You know what you two look like?
- What?

1774
02:09:35,400 --> 02:09:37,730
Like a couple of guys who
just blew off somebody's head.

1775
02:09:38,900 --> 02:09:42,280
Strippin' off those bloody
rags is absolutely necessary.

1776
02:09:46,580 --> 02:09:48,410
Toss 'em in Jimmie's
garbage bag.

1777
02:09:48,490 --> 02:09:50,890
Don't do nothin'
stupid, like leavin' this

1778
02:09:50,900 --> 02:09:53,540
shit out front for the
garbage man to pick up.

1779
02:09:53,620 --> 02:09:57,840
Don't worry, we're taking
it with us. Jim, the soap.

1780
02:09:59,300 --> 02:10:01,210
- Vincent.
- Okay, gentlemen.

1781
02:10:01,300 --> 02:10:04,800
You both been to county
before, I'm sure. Here it comes.

1782
02:10:04,890 --> 02:10:07,760
- Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!
- Yo! Yo! Yo!

1783
02:10:07,850 --> 02:10:11,060
Better you than me, gentlemen.

1784
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:14,060
Don't be afraid of the
soap. Spread it around.

1785
02:10:14,150 --> 02:10:15,960
Get 'em there a little
bit. Vincent's hair.

1786
02:10:15,970 --> 02:10:17,020
Hey, get out of my hair!

1787
02:10:17,110 --> 02:10:19,980
Come on, do it,
goddamn it! Do it!

1788
02:10:21,070 --> 02:10:22,490
Towel.

1789
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:36,670
You're dry enough.
Toss 'em their clothes.

1790
02:10:38,250 --> 02:10:40,050
Perfect.

1791
02:10:40,130 --> 02:10:42,550
Perfect. We couldn't
have planned this better.

1792
02:10:43,630 --> 02:10:45,550
You guys look like-.

1793
02:10:45,640 --> 02:10:48,050
What do they look like, Jimmie?

1794
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:51,850
Dorks. They look
like a couple of dorks.

1795
02:10:52,810 --> 02:10:55,310
Ha-ha-ha. They're your
clothes, motherfucker.

1796
02:10:55,390 --> 02:10:58,100
Come on, gentlemen. We're
laughing our way right into prison.

1797
02:10:58,190 --> 02:11:00,150
Don't make me beg.

1798
02:11:03,190 --> 02:11:06,610
Okay, gentlemen, let's get
our rules of the road straight.

1799
02:11:06,700 --> 02:11:09,200
We're going to a place called
Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1800
02:11:09,830 --> 02:11:13,240
Now, Monster Joe and his daughter
Raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1801
02:11:13,330 --> 02:11:15,210
The place is North Hollywood...

1802
02:11:15,290 --> 02:11:19,290
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1803
02:11:19,380 --> 02:11:22,710
Now, I'll drive the tainted
car. Jules, you ride with me.

1804
02:11:24,090 --> 02:11:26,050
Vincent, you follow in my Acura.

1805
02:11:26,130 --> 02:11:30,010
Now, if we come across the
path of any John Q. Laws...

1806
02:11:30,100 --> 02:11:32,780
nobody does a fuckin'
thing 'til I do something.

1807
02:11:32,790 --> 02:11:33,220
Right.

1808
02:11:33,310 --> 02:11:36,180
- What did I say?
- Don't do shit unless.

1809
02:11:36,270 --> 02:11:38,560
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.

1810
02:11:38,650 --> 02:11:41,020
Spoken like a true prodigy.

1811
02:11:41,110 --> 02:11:44,530
How about you, Lash LaRue? Can you
keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?

1812
02:11:44,610 --> 02:11:48,740
The gun went off. I don't know
why. I'm cool, I promise you.

1813
02:11:48,820 --> 02:11:51,740
Fair enough. Now, I drive
real fuckin' fast, so keep up.

1814
02:11:51,830 --> 02:11:54,330
If I get my car back any
different than I gave it...

1815
02:11:54,410 --> 02:11:57,290
Monster Joe's gonna be
disposing of two bodies.

1816
02:12:01,170 --> 02:12:02,880
Outta my way, Rex.

1817
02:12:04,420 --> 02:12:06,840
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.

1818
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:10,680
- All right.
- Boys, this is Raquel.

1819
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:13,390
Someday all this will be hers.

1820
02:12:13,470 --> 02:12:16,310
Hi. So, what's with the outfits?

1821
02:12:16,390 --> 02:12:18,770
You guys going to a
volleyball game or something?

1822
02:12:20,940 --> 02:12:22,860
I'm takin' milady
out to breakfast.

1823
02:12:22,940 --> 02:12:25,150
Maybe I could drop you
two off. Where do you live?

1824
02:12:25,230 --> 02:12:26,610
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

1825
02:12:26,690 --> 02:12:30,110
It's your future.

1826
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:32,950
I see a cab ride.

1827
02:12:33,030 --> 02:12:35,990
Move outta the sticks,
fellas. Say good night, Raquel.

1828
02:12:36,080 --> 02:12:39,000
- Good night, Raquel.
- I'll see you guys around.

1829
02:12:39,080 --> 02:12:40,710
Stay outta trouble,
you crazy kids.

1830
02:12:40,790 --> 02:12:44,500
Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it
was a real pleasure watching you work.

1831
02:12:44,590 --> 02:12:47,260
Yeah, really. And thank
you very much, Mr. Wolf.

1832
02:12:48,590 --> 02:12:50,510
Call me Winston.

1833
02:12:52,090 --> 02:12:55,010
You see that,
young lady? Respect.

1834
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:59,270
- Respect for one's elders shows character.
- I have character.

1835
02:12:59,350 --> 02:13:03,350
Because you are a character
doesn't mean that you have character.

1836
02:13:10,950 --> 02:13:12,910
Wanna share a cab?

1837
02:13:12,990 --> 02:13:17,240
I'd go for some breakfast. Feel
like havin' breakfast with me?

1838
02:13:17,330 --> 02:13:18,620
Cool.

1839
02:13:24,130 --> 02:13:27,250
I don't know why, I just thought
he'd be European or something.

1840
02:13:27,340 --> 02:13:29,420
Yeah, he's about as European
as fuckin' English Bob.

1841
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:31,760
- I know that now.
- But was he cool or what?

1842
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:35,760
- Thank you.
- Totally fuckin' cool, in control.

1843
02:13:35,850 --> 02:13:39,890
Didn't even really get pissed when
you were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.

1844
02:13:40,980 --> 02:13:42,560
Want some bacon?

1845
02:13:42,650 --> 02:13:45,400
- No, man, I don't eat pork.
- Are you Jewish?

1846
02:13:45,480 --> 02:13:48,070
I ain't Jewish; I just don't
dig on swine, that's all.

1847
02:13:48,150 --> 02:13:51,070
- Why not?
- Pigs are filthy animals.

1848
02:13:51,150 --> 02:13:53,070
I don't eat filthy animals.

1849
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:56,570
Yeah, but bacon tastes
good. Pork chops taste good.

1850
02:13:56,660 --> 02:13:59,580
Sewer rat may taste like
pumpkin pie, but I'd never know...

1851
02:13:59,660 --> 02:14:01,500
'cause I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.

1852
02:14:02,670 --> 02:14:05,580
Pigs sleep and root in
shit. That's a filthy animal.

1853
02:14:05,670 --> 02:14:09,340
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense
enough to disregard its own feces.

1854
02:14:09,420 --> 02:14:11,970
How about a dog?
Dog eats its own feces.

1855
02:14:12,050 --> 02:14:13,970
I don't eat dog either.

1856
02:14:14,050 --> 02:14:17,390
Yeah, but do you consider
a dog to be a filthy animal?

1857
02:14:17,470 --> 02:14:20,100
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy...

1858
02:14:20,180 --> 02:14:21,980
but they're definitely dirty.

1859
02:14:22,060 --> 02:14:25,020
But a dog's got personality.
Personality goes a long way.

1860
02:14:25,100 --> 02:14:26,600
So, by that rationale...

1861
02:14:26,690 --> 02:14:28,870
if a pig had a better
personality, he would

1862
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:31,030
cease to be a filthy
animal, is that true?

1863
02:14:31,110 --> 02:14:34,240
We'd have to be talkin' about
one charming motherfuckin' pig.

1864
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:38,370
I mean, he'd have to be 10 times more
charming than that Arnold on Green Acres.

1865
02:14:43,960 --> 02:14:46,080
Oh, man, that's good.

1866
02:14:46,170 --> 02:14:49,750
That's good, man.
You're startin' to lighten up.

1867
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:52,260
You've been sittin'
there, all serious and shit.

1868
02:14:52,340 --> 02:14:55,300
- I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.
- About what?

1869
02:14:55,380 --> 02:14:56,840
About the miracle we witnessed.

1870
02:14:56,930 --> 02:15:00,220
Miracle you witnessed. I
witnessed a freak occurrence.

1871
02:15:00,310 --> 02:15:01,640
What is a miracle, Vincent?

1872
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:06,770
- Act of God.
- And what's an act of God?

1873
02:15:10,270 --> 02:15:14,110
When God makes the
impossible possible.

1874
02:15:15,110 --> 02:15:17,030
But this morning...

1875
02:15:17,110 --> 02:15:19,820
- I don't think qualifies.
- Hey, Vincent.

1876
02:15:19,910 --> 02:15:23,620
See, that shit don't matter. You're
judging this shit the wrong way.

1877
02:15:23,700 --> 02:15:28,630
It could be God stopped the bullets,
changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys.

1878
02:15:28,710 --> 02:15:31,670
You don't judge shit
like this based on merit.

1879
02:15:31,750 --> 02:15:34,210
Now, whether or not
what we experienced...

1880
02:15:34,300 --> 02:15:37,430
was an According-to-Hoyle
miracle is insignificant.

1881
02:15:37,510 --> 02:15:41,260
But what is significant
is, I felt the touch of God.

1882
02:15:41,350 --> 02:15:43,260
God got involved.

1883
02:15:43,350 --> 02:15:45,060
But why?

1884
02:15:45,140 --> 02:15:48,190
Well, that's what's fuckin'
with me: I don't know why.

1885
02:15:48,270 --> 02:15:51,230
- But I can't go back to sleep.
- You're serious.

1886
02:15:51,320 --> 02:15:53,190
You're really
thinkin' about quittin'.

1887
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:55,940
- For life? Most definitely.
- Yeah.

1888
02:15:56,030 --> 02:15:59,360
Fuck. What you gonna do then?

1889
02:16:00,700 --> 02:16:04,910
Well, that's what I been
sitting here contemplating.

1890
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:08,580
First I'm gonna deliver
this case to Marsellus.

1891
02:16:08,670 --> 02:16:11,750
Then, basically, I'm
just gonna walk the earth.

1892
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:15,250
- What you mean, "'Walk the earth"?
- Like Caine in Kung Fu.

1893
02:16:15,340 --> 02:16:18,300
Walk from place to place,
meet people, get in adventures.

1894
02:16:18,380 --> 02:16:20,640
And how long do you
intend to walk the earth?

1895
02:16:20,720 --> 02:16:24,010
- 'Til God puts me where he wants me to be.
- What if he don't do that?

1896
02:16:24,100 --> 02:16:26,470
If it takes forever,
then I'll walk forever.

1897
02:16:26,560 --> 02:16:29,020
So you decided to be a bum.

1898
02:16:29,100 --> 02:16:32,730
I'll just be Jules,
Vincent. No more, no less.

1899
02:16:32,820 --> 02:16:34,770
No, Jules, you
decided to be a bum...

1900
02:16:34,860 --> 02:16:38,150
just like all those pieces of shit
out there who beg for change...

1901
02:16:38,240 --> 02:16:41,160
who sleep in garbage
bins, eat what I throw away.

1902
02:16:41,240 --> 02:16:44,200
They got a name for that,
Jules-It's called a bum.

1903
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:47,950
And without a job, a residence or legal
tender, that's what you're gonna be, man.

1904
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:49,910
You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.

1905
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,920
Look, my friend, this is
just where you and I differ.

1906
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,840
Garcon! Coffee!

1907
02:16:55,920 --> 02:17:00,430
Jules, look, what happened this
morning, man, I agree it was peculiar.

1908
02:17:00,510 --> 02:17:03,590
- But water into wine, I...
- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.

1909
02:17:03,680 --> 02:17:06,810
- Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man.
- If my answers frighten you...

1910
02:17:06,890 --> 02:17:09,430
then you should cease
asking scary questions.

1911
02:17:12,350 --> 02:17:14,270
I'm gonna take a shit.

1912
02:17:18,150 --> 02:17:19,690
Let me ask you something.

1913
02:17:19,780 --> 02:17:23,160
When did you make this decision, when
you were sittin' there eatin' that muffin?

1914
02:17:23,240 --> 02:17:27,160
Yeah. I was sittin' here eatin'
my muffin, drinkin' my coffee...

1915
02:17:27,240 --> 02:17:29,160
replayin' the
incident in my head...

1916
02:17:29,250 --> 02:17:33,080
when I had what alcoholics
refer to as a moment of clarity.

1917
02:17:33,710 --> 02:17:36,250
Fuck. To be continued.

1918
02:17:48,270 --> 02:17:51,230
- I love you, pumpkin.
- I love you, honey bunny.

1919
02:17:52,810 --> 02:17:54,900
Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!

1920
02:17:54,980 --> 02:17:57,610
Any one of you
fucking pricks move...

1921
02:17:57,690 --> 02:18:00,820
and I'll execute every
one of you motherfuckers!

1922
02:18:00,900 --> 02:18:04,280
You got that? You
just be quiet over there!

1923
02:18:04,360 --> 02:18:07,410
Get on the fuckin'-
get the fuck down!

1924
02:18:07,490 --> 02:18:12,210
You're in a blind spot. Take your dames
over to that booth, on the count often!

1925
02:18:12,290 --> 02:18:16,830
- Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen!
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8-.

1926
02:18:16,920 --> 02:18:20,000
What the fuck are you doing,
you fucking yuppie? Get down!

1927
02:18:20,090 --> 02:18:22,550
- Get down!
- Throw those bags!

1928
02:18:22,630 --> 02:18:25,130
Fucking move! Move!

1929
02:18:25,220 --> 02:18:27,470
Move! Get the fuck-

1930
02:18:27,550 --> 02:18:30,560
Get down on the fucking floor!

1931
02:18:30,640 --> 02:18:32,560
Grandpa! Down!

1932
02:18:32,640 --> 02:18:36,020
I'm the manager here, and there's
no problem. No problem at all.

1933
02:18:36,110 --> 02:18:39,020
- You gonna give me a problem?
- No, sir, I'm not.

1934
02:18:39,110 --> 02:18:43,110
Thought you said you were
gonna give me a fucking problem!

1935
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:47,870
- I think we got a hero here, honey bunny.
- Well, just execute him!

1936
02:18:48,490 --> 02:18:50,240
I am not a hero.

1937
02:18:50,330 --> 02:18:53,000
- I'm just a coffee shop manager.
- Get the fuck down!

1938
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:54,830
The restaurant's ours!

1939
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:57,830
Just take whatever you want.

1940
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:59,840
- You talk to the customers.
- Yeah.

1941
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:03,050
You tell them to be fucking
cool and everything will be over.

1942
02:19:03,130 --> 02:19:05,090
- You understand me?
- Yes!

1943
02:19:07,390 --> 02:19:11,260
Listen, everybody.
Be calm, cooperate...

1944
02:19:11,350 --> 02:19:14,270
and this'll all be
over in a minute!

1945
02:19:14,350 --> 02:19:16,350
Get the fuck down! Well done.

1946
02:19:28,660 --> 02:19:32,120
All right, now, people, gonna
come around and collect your wallets!

1947
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:35,620
You don't fucking talk, you just
throw 'em in the bag! Are we clear?

1948
02:19:35,710 --> 02:19:37,960
I said, are we fucking clear?

1949
02:19:38,040 --> 02:19:39,920
Good! Now, wallets out!

1950
02:19:41,630 --> 02:19:44,630
That's it. Get the
fuck down. In the bag.

1951
02:19:44,720 --> 02:19:47,630
- In the fucking bag!
- I don't have nothin' on me, man.

1952
02:19:47,720 --> 02:19:49,550
In the bag.

1953
02:19:50,350 --> 02:19:52,560
What am I waiting
for? In the fucking bag.

1954
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:55,560
Laura. Laura. Tips. In the bag.

1955
02:19:56,390 --> 02:19:57,850
- Is that a cellular phone?
- Yeah.

1956
02:19:57,940 --> 02:19:59,480
In the fucking bag.

1957
02:20:01,440 --> 02:20:04,900
Tidy up, tidy up, that's it. Now
get the fuck down on the floor.

1958
02:20:04,990 --> 02:20:07,400
In the bag. In the bag.

1959
02:20:19,580 --> 02:20:21,540
In the bag.

1960
02:20:36,640 --> 02:20:39,560
- What's in the case?
- My boss' dirty laundry.

1961
02:20:39,650 --> 02:20:42,190
- Your boss makes you do his laundry?
- When he wants it clean.

1962
02:20:42,270 --> 02:20:44,940
- Sounds like a shit job.
- Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.

1963
02:20:45,030 --> 02:20:47,940
- Open it.
- 'Fraid I can't do that.

1964
02:20:49,990 --> 02:20:52,320
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, you did.

1965
02:20:53,450 --> 02:20:55,740
What's going on?

1966
02:20:55,830 --> 02:20:57,700
Looks like we got a
vigilante in our midst.

1967
02:20:57,790 --> 02:20:59,290
Shoot him in the face!

1968
02:20:59,370 --> 02:21:01,170
I hate to shatter
your ego, but this ain't

1969
02:21:01,190 --> 02:21:03,080
the first time I've had
a gun pointed at me.

1970
02:21:03,170 --> 02:21:05,610
If you don't take your hand
off that case, it'll be your last.

1971
02:21:05,630 --> 02:21:06,880
Stop causing problems!

1972
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:09,480
You'll get us all killed! Give 'em
what you got and get 'em outta here!

1973
02:21:09,510 --> 02:21:13,720
Shut the fuck up, fat man! This
ain't none of your goddamn business!

1974
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:16,060
Be cool, honey bunny, be cool.

1975
02:21:16,140 --> 02:21:18,180
No problem. I got
it under control.

1976
02:21:19,810 --> 02:21:21,810
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

1977
02:21:23,400 --> 02:21:27,320
If you don't open that case, I'm
gonna unload in your fucking face.

1978
02:21:31,740 --> 02:21:33,160
We clear?

1979
02:21:36,830 --> 02:21:38,740
One.

1980
02:21:40,580 --> 02:21:43,080
Two.

1981
02:21:43,170 --> 02:21:45,210
- Three.
- Okay, Ringo.

1982
02:21:45,290 --> 02:21:47,380
You win.

1983
02:21:47,460 --> 02:21:49,380
It's yours.

1984
02:21:54,430 --> 02:21:56,180
Open it.

1985
02:22:00,020 --> 02:22:02,230
Hey, what is it?

1986
02:22:02,310 --> 02:22:04,650
What is it?

1987
02:22:04,730 --> 02:22:07,360
Is that what I think it is?

1988
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:13,780
It's beautiful.

1989
02:22:13,860 --> 02:22:16,410
Goddamn it, what is it?

1990
02:22:17,910 --> 02:22:20,830
You let him go! You let him go!

1991
02:22:20,910 --> 02:22:23,870
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!
- Tell that bitch to be cool.

1992
02:22:23,960 --> 02:22:26,040
- Say, '"Bitch, be cool!"
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"

1993
02:22:26,050 --> 02:22:26,880
- Be cool! Be cool!

1994
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:29,670
- Tell that bitch to chill!
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!

1995
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:32,630
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out, honey bunny!

1996
02:22:32,720 --> 02:22:34,510
- Let go of him!
- Chill out, honey bunny!

1997
02:22:34,590 --> 02:22:37,510
- Now, promise her it's gonna be all right!
- I promise!

1998
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:39,470
- Tell her to chill!
- Chill out, honey bunny!

1999
02:22:39,560 --> 02:22:41,470
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

2000
02:22:41,560 --> 02:22:44,980
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we?

2001
02:22:45,060 --> 02:22:47,980
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

2002
02:22:48,070 --> 02:22:51,570
We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?

2003
02:22:51,650 --> 02:22:55,320
- Come on, Yolanda! What's Fonzie like?
- He's cool.

2004
02:22:55,410 --> 02:22:57,280
- What?
- Cool.

2005
02:22:57,370 --> 02:23:00,200
Correctamundo. And
that's what we're gonna be.

2006
02:23:00,290 --> 02:23:02,200
We're gonna be cool.

2007
02:23:02,290 --> 02:23:07,170
Now, Ringo, I'm
gonna count to three.

2008
02:23:07,250 --> 02:23:09,340
And when I count three...

2009
02:23:09,420 --> 02:23:12,340
I want you to let
go of your gun...

2010
02:23:12,420 --> 02:23:15,930
put your palms flat on the
table and sit your ass down.

2011
02:23:16,970 --> 02:23:19,010
And when you do it...

2012
02:23:19,100 --> 02:23:21,180
you do it cool.

2013
02:23:21,260 --> 02:23:23,560
You ready?

2014
02:23:23,640 --> 02:23:25,730
One...

2015
02:23:25,810 --> 02:23:28,020
two...

2016
02:23:28,110 --> 02:23:30,020
three.

2017
02:23:36,990 --> 02:23:40,120
- Okay, now you let him go!
- Yolanda!

2018
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:43,790
I thought you were gonna be cool. Now,
when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.

2019
02:23:43,870 --> 02:23:45,960
When I get
nervous, I get scared.

2020
02:23:46,040 --> 02:23:49,830
When motherfuckers get scared, that's
when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.

2021
02:23:51,500 --> 02:23:55,130
Just know, you
hurt him, you die.

2022
02:23:55,220 --> 02:23:58,590
Well, that seems
to be the situation.

2023
02:23:58,680 --> 02:24:00,590
But I don't want that.

2024
02:24:00,680 --> 02:24:02,600
And you don't want that.

2025
02:24:02,680 --> 02:24:05,390
And Ringo here
definitely doesn't want that.

2026
02:24:05,480 --> 02:24:07,600
So let's see what we can do.

2027
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:13,230
Now... here's the situation.

2028
02:24:13,320 --> 02:24:17,150
Normally both your asses would
be dead as fuckin' fried chicken...

2029
02:24:17,240 --> 02:24:20,160
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period...

2030
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:22,660
and I don't wanna kill
you; I wanna help you.

2031
02:24:22,740 --> 02:24:27,500
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

2032
02:24:27,580 --> 02:24:30,670
Besides, I been through too much
shit over this case this morning...

2033
02:24:30,750 --> 02:24:33,670
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

2034
02:24:33,750 --> 02:24:35,590
Vincent!

2035
02:24:35,670 --> 02:24:38,590
- Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
- Get back!

2036
02:24:38,680 --> 02:24:41,390
It's cool! We
still just talkin'.

2037
02:24:41,470 --> 02:24:44,890
Come on. Point the gun
at me. Point the gun at me.

2038
02:24:44,970 --> 02:24:47,770
There you go. Now,
Vincent, you just hang back...

2039
02:24:47,850 --> 02:24:49,770
and don't do a goddamn thing.

2040
02:24:49,850 --> 02:24:51,770
Tell her it's still cool.

2041
02:24:51,860 --> 02:24:54,730
- It's still cool, honey bunny.
- How we doin', baby?

2042
02:24:56,190 --> 02:24:58,820
I gotta go pee.

2043
02:24:58,900 --> 02:25:00,820
I wanna go home.

2044
02:25:00,910 --> 02:25:04,490
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud
of you. And Ringo's proud of you.

2045
02:25:04,580 --> 02:25:07,500
It's almost over. Tell
her you're proud of her.

2046
02:25:07,580 --> 02:25:10,920
- I'm proud of you, honey bunny.
- I love you.

2047
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:12,880
I love you too, honey bunny.

2048
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:18,210
Now, I want you to go in
that bag and find my wallet.

2049
02:25:20,720 --> 02:25:24,260
- Which one is it?
- It's the one that says bad motherfucker.

2050
02:25:38,940 --> 02:25:42,320
That's it. That's my
bad motherfucker.

2051
02:25:42,410 --> 02:25:44,700
Open it up. Take out the money.

2052
02:25:50,250 --> 02:25:51,910
Count it.

2053
02:25:58,210 --> 02:26:00,760
How much is there?

2054
02:26:02,630 --> 02:26:04,550
About 1,500 dollars.

2055
02:26:04,640 --> 02:26:07,810
Okay, put it in your
pocket. It's yours.

2056
02:26:07,890 --> 02:26:11,100
Now, with the rest of those
wallets and the register...

2057
02:26:11,180 --> 02:26:13,300
that makes this a pretty
successful little score, huh?

2058
02:26:13,350 --> 02:26:15,480
Jules, you give that fuckin'
nimrod 1,500 dollars...

2059
02:26:15,560 --> 02:26:17,230
and I'll shoot him
on general principle.

2060
02:26:17,320 --> 02:26:20,230
No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!

2061
02:26:20,320 --> 02:26:22,900
Vince, shut the fuck up!

2062
02:26:22,990 --> 02:26:26,870
- Shut up!
- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

2063
02:26:26,950 --> 02:26:29,870
Now, I ain't givin'
it to him, Vincent.

2064
02:26:29,950 --> 02:26:31,830
I'm buyin' something
for my money.

2065
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:36,290
- Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?
- What?

2066
02:26:36,380 --> 02:26:41,090
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

2067
02:26:41,170 --> 02:26:43,840
You read the Bible, Ringo?

2068
02:26:44,970 --> 02:26:46,890
Not regularly, no.

2069
02:26:46,970 --> 02:26:49,350
Well, there's this
passage I got memorized.

2070
02:26:49,430 --> 02:26:52,980
Ezekiel 25:17.

2071
02:26:53,060 --> 02:26:56,310
"The path of the righteous
man is beset on all sides..."

2072
02:26:56,400 --> 02:26:59,860
by the inequities of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men.

2073
02:26:59,940 --> 02:27:03,320
Blessed is he who, in the
name of charity and good will...

2074
02:27:03,400 --> 02:27:05,820
shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness...

2075
02:27:05,910 --> 02:27:09,990
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

2076
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:14,370
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

2077
02:27:14,460 --> 02:27:17,500
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers.

2078
02:27:17,580 --> 02:27:20,590
And you will know
I am the Lord...

2079
02:27:20,670 --> 02:27:23,340
"when I lay my
vengeance upon you."

2080
02:27:25,340 --> 02:27:27,760
I been sayin' that
shit for years...

2081
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:30,970
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2082
02:27:31,060 --> 02:27:33,970
I never gave much
thought to what it meant.

2083
02:27:34,060 --> 02:27:36,980
I just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

2084
02:27:37,060 --> 02:27:39,480
before I popped
a cap in his ass.

2085
02:27:39,560 --> 02:27:41,980
But I saw some shit this
morning made me think twice.

2086
02:27:43,070 --> 02:27:45,990
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...

2087
02:27:46,070 --> 02:27:50,950
you're the evil man, and
I'm the righteous man...

2088
02:27:51,030 --> 02:27:53,950
and Mr. 9-millimeter
here, he's the shepherd...

2089
02:27:54,040 --> 02:27:57,580
protecting my righteous
ass in the Valley of Darkness.

2090
02:27:57,670 --> 02:27:59,580
Or it could mean...

2091
02:27:59,670 --> 02:28:03,090
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd...

2092
02:28:03,170 --> 02:28:07,090
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2093
02:28:07,180 --> 02:28:09,430
Yeah, I'd like that.

2094
02:28:09,510 --> 02:28:12,390
But that shit ain't the truth.

2095
02:28:12,470 --> 02:28:14,350
The truth is...

2096
02:28:15,390 --> 02:28:18,060
you're the weak...

2097
02:28:18,730 --> 02:28:22,110
and I'm the tyranny of evil men.

2098
02:28:23,570 --> 02:28:25,480
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2099
02:28:26,740 --> 02:28:31,410
I'm tryin' real hard
to be the shepherd.

2100
02:28:47,340 --> 02:28:49,260
Go.

2101
02:29:07,440 --> 02:29:09,400
I think we should
be leaving now.

2102
02:29:10,160 --> 02:29:11,910
Yeah, that's
probably a good idea.
