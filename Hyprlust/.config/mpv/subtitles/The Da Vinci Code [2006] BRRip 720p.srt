1
00:02:11,312 --> 00:02:12,347
Stop now.

2
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:14,747
Tell me where it is.

3
00:02:20,404 --> 00:02:24,317
You and your brethren possess
what is not rightfully yours.

4
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:28,863
I don't know what
you are talking about.

5
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:31,973
Is it a secret you will die for?

6
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,445
- Please.
- As you wish.

7
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:37,280
Wait!

8
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:43,536
My God, forgive me.

9
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:47,013
In the sacristy...

10
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,627
...the church of Saint-Sulpice,
is the Rose Line.

11
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:53,011
Beneath the Rose.

12
00:02:55,855 --> 00:02:57,208
Thank you.

13
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:32,082
Thank you.

14
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:34,054
Thank you.

15
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:50,071
Symbols are a language that
can help us understand our past.

16
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:54,984
As the saying goes,
a picture says a thousand words...

17
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,248
...but which words?

18
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:02,563
Interpret for me, please, this symbol.
First thing that comes to mind.

19
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:05,114
- Hatred, racism.
- Ku Klux Klan.

20
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:10,449
Yes, yes, interesting. But they would
disagree with you in Spain.

21
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,207
There, they are robes
worn by priests.

22
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,591
Now this symbol. Anyone?

23
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:18,013
Evil.

24
00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:20,386
In English, please.

25
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:21,679
Devil's pitchfork.

26
00:04:21,937 --> 00:04:24,007
Poor, poor Poseidon.

27
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:29,593
That is his trident. A symbol of power
to millions of the ancients.

28
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:31,097
Now this symbol.

29
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,594
- Madonna and child.
- Faith. Christianity.

30
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:38,503
No. No, it's the pagan god
Horus and his mother, Isis...

31
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,304
...centuries before
the birth of Christ.

32
00:04:41,623 --> 00:04:45,172
Understanding our past
determines actively...

33
00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:48,455
...our ability to understand
the present.

34
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:53,233
So how do we sift truth from belief?

35
00:04:53,718 --> 00:04:57,074
How do we write our own histories,
personally or culturally...

36
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,421
...and thereby define ourselves?

37
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:03,875
How do we penetrate years,
centuries, of historical distortion...

38
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,193
...to find original truth?

39
00:05:07,523 --> 00:05:10,595
Tonight, this will be our quest.

40
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,776
My son is a student
of yours at Harvard.

41
00:05:14,112 --> 00:05:16,262
- Michael Culp? He adores you.
- Oh, yeah.

42
00:05:16,573 --> 00:05:18,484
He says you're the best teacher
he's ever had.

43
00:05:18,783 --> 00:05:22,571
Ms. Culp, I think I already gave
Michael an A-minus.

44
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:24,273
He told me. Thank you.

45
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:25,767
Mr. Langdon?

46
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,815
Hi.

47
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:29,358
<i>Bonjour,</i> professor.

48
00:05:30,336 --> 00:05:35,410
I'm Lieutenant Collet from DCPJ.
A kind of French FBI.

49
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:38,601
Will you take a look
at this photo, please?

50
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:41,647
My police chief, Capitaine Fache,
had hoped...

51
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:45,408
...considering your expertise
and the markings on the body...

52
00:05:45,768 --> 00:05:47,121
...you might assist us.

53
00:05:55,944 --> 00:05:57,935
Will you excuse me a moment?

54
00:06:01,324 --> 00:06:03,042
I was supposed to have
drinks with him.

55
00:06:03,326 --> 00:06:04,475
Yes, we know.

56
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,906
We found your name
in his daily planner.

57
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:11,804
He never showed.
I waited for over an hour.

58
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:17,731
Why would someone do this to him?

59
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:21,007
Oh, you misunderstand, professor.

60
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,501
He was shot, yes.

61
00:06:23,888 --> 00:06:26,356
But what you see
in the photograph...

62
00:06:26,682 --> 00:06:29,150
...Monsieur Saunière did to himself.

63
00:06:32,396 --> 00:06:36,435
Teacher, all four are dead.

64
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,479
The <i>sénéchaux</i> and the
Grand Master himself.

65
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,732
<i>Then I assume</i>
<i>you have the location.</i>

66
00:06:44,074 --> 00:06:47,032
Confirmed by all.

67
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:49,643
Independently.

68
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:54,656
<i>I had feared the Priory's penchant</i>
<i>for secrecy might prevail.</i>

69
00:06:58,421 --> 00:07:02,334
The prospect of death
is strong motivation.

70
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,245
It is here.

71
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,914
In Paris, Teacher.

72
00:07:12,017 --> 00:07:17,216
It hides beneath the Rose
in Saint-Sulpice.

73
00:07:17,981 --> 00:07:20,575
<i>You will go forth, Silas.</i>

74
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,955
I chastise my body.

75
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:16,918
Capitaine Fache is waiting for you.

76
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:26,581
Okay.

77
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,343
- Mr. Langdon.
- Yes.

78
00:09:39,951 --> 00:09:41,748
I'm Captain Bezu Fache.

79
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:44,231
You like our pyramid?

80
00:09:44,497 --> 00:09:45,486
It's magnificent.

81
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:48,170
A scar on the face of Paris.

82
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,178
After me, please.

83
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:00,960
It's the pairing
of those two pyramids.

84
00:10:01,555 --> 00:10:02,783
It's unique.

85
00:10:03,056 --> 00:10:05,092
The two are geometric echoes.

86
00:10:05,392 --> 00:10:06,347
Fascinating.

87
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:12,455
I'm not sure how much help
I'm gonna be here this evening.

88
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:15,917
How well did you know the curator?

89
00:10:16,235 --> 00:10:17,304
Not very well.

90
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,006
Frankly, I was surprised
when he contacted me.

91
00:10:29,248 --> 00:10:31,478
Could we take the stairs?

92
00:10:46,181 --> 00:10:49,298
So Saunière requested
tonight's meeting.

93
00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:50,711
Yes.

94
00:10:50,977 --> 00:10:52,376
How? Did he call you?

95
00:10:54,105 --> 00:10:57,222
E-mail. He heard I was in Paris.

96
00:10:58,442 --> 00:11:00,160
Had something to discuss.

97
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:01,479
What?

98
00:11:06,575 --> 00:11:09,692
You seem uncomfortable.

99
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:24,760
The Grand Gallery.
This is where you found the body.

100
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:26,853
How would you know that?

101
00:11:27,971 --> 00:11:32,647
I recognize the parquet floor
from the Polaroid. It's unmistakable.

102
00:11:42,276 --> 00:11:43,504
Dear God.

103
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:49,636
Let's cover the talking points again,
Your Eminence.

104
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,703
Many call Opus Dei
a brainwashing cult.

105
00:11:53,036 --> 00:11:55,186
Others, an ultraconservative
Christian secret society.

106
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:58,091
Obviously, some people fear
what they don't understand.

107
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,647
Perhaps a less defensive tack,
Your Eminence.

108
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:03,031
The press continue
to be harsh with us.

109
00:12:04,965 --> 00:12:08,924
We are not Cafeteria Catholics.

110
00:12:09,302 --> 00:12:11,213
We don't pick and choose
which rules to follow.

111
00:12:11,513 --> 00:12:14,027
We follow doctrine. Rigorously.

112
00:12:14,974 --> 00:12:18,523
Does doctrine necessarily
include vows of chastity, tithing...

113
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:21,887
...and atonement for sins through
self-flagellation and the cilice?

114
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:26,486
Many of our followers are married.
Many of them have families.

115
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:29,546
Only a small proportion
choose to live ascetic lives.

116
00:12:29,863 --> 00:12:33,173
- Why are some media referring..?
- That will be all, Michael, thank you.

117
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:34,649
Aringarosa.

118
00:12:35,869 --> 00:12:39,384
<i>Silas has succeeded.</i>
<i>The legend is true.</i>

119
00:12:39,873 --> 00:12:41,670
<i>It hides beneath the Rose.</i>

120
00:12:42,084 --> 00:12:44,962
<i>My part of our bargain</i>
<i>is nearly fulfilled.</i>

121
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,548
I meet the council in an hour.

122
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:52,522
I will have your money tonight,
Teacher.

123
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:55,122
<i>The Vitruvian Man.</i>

124
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,717
It's one of Leonardo da Vinci's
most famous sketches.

125
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:00,935
And the star on his skin?

126
00:13:01,435 --> 00:13:02,390
A pentacle.

127
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:04,120
And its meaning?

128
00:13:04,397 --> 00:13:06,467
The pentacle is
a pagan religious icon.

129
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:08,746
Devil worship.

130
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:13,577
No. No, no, no.
The pentacle before that.

131
00:13:14,281 --> 00:13:16,351
This is a symbol for Venus.

132
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:19,464
It represents the female half
of all things...

133
00:13:19,786 --> 00:13:22,425
You are telling me that
Saunière's last act on earth...

134
00:13:22,748 --> 00:13:26,741
...was to draw a goddess symbol
on his chest? Why?

135
00:13:28,295 --> 00:13:31,412
Captain Fache,
obviously I can't tell you why.

136
00:13:32,465 --> 00:13:36,253
I can tell you he, as well as anyone,
knows the meaning of this symbol...

137
00:13:36,636 --> 00:13:38,911
...and it has nothing to do
with worshiping the devil.

138
00:13:39,222 --> 00:13:40,496
- Is that so?
- Yes.

139
00:13:40,765 --> 00:13:41,959
Then...

140
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:45,069
...what do you make of this?

141
00:13:45,603 --> 00:13:49,642
"O, Draconian devil.
Oh, lame saint."

142
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:53,016
It's a phrase.
Doesn't mean anything, not to me.

143
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:56,925
What would you do if you had such
limited time to send a message?

144
00:13:58,615 --> 00:14:02,972
Well, I suppose
I'd try to identify my killer.

145
00:14:03,954 --> 00:14:04,943
Precisely.

146
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:07,302
Precisely.

147
00:14:07,582 --> 00:14:08,697
So, professor...

148
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,166
Officer Neveu.

149
00:14:12,462 --> 00:14:13,815
Please, pardon the interruption.

150
00:14:14,088 --> 00:14:15,043
This is not the time.

151
00:14:15,298 --> 00:14:17,368
I received the crime-scene jpegs
at headquarters...

152
00:14:17,675 --> 00:14:19,393
...and I've deciphered the code.

153
00:14:19,802 --> 00:14:21,281
It's a Fibonacci sequence.

154
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:23,863
That's the code Saunière
left on the floor.

155
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:26,263
Headquarters sent me
to explain, captain.

156
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,833
It is the Fibonacci sequence.

157
00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:29,376
The numbers are out of order.

158
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:32,318
But before that, I have an urgent
message for Professor Langdon.

159
00:14:32,648 --> 00:14:33,797
Right?

160
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,549
Pardon me?

161
00:14:37,986 --> 00:14:40,819
I'm Sophie Neveu,
French police, Cryptology.

162
00:14:41,156 --> 00:14:43,067
Your embassy called Division.

163
00:14:47,996 --> 00:14:52,069
I'm sorry, monsieur, they said
it was a matter of life and death.

164
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:56,444
This is the number of your
embassy's messaging service.

165
00:14:57,171 --> 00:14:58,490
Well, thank you.

166
00:15:05,846 --> 00:15:07,916
<i>Hello, you've reached</i>
<i>the home of Sophie Neveu.</i>

167
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,534
Miss Neveu? This...

168
00:15:11,852 --> 00:15:13,331
No. That's the right number.

169
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:15,993
You have to dial an access code
to pick up your messages.

170
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,270
But I'm getting...

171
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:20,243
It's a three-digit code.
It's on the paper I gave you.

172
00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:32,327
<i>Professor Langdon,</i>
<i>do not react to this message.</i>

173
00:15:32,664 --> 00:15:35,736
<i>You must follow my directions</i>
<i>very closely and, above all...</i>

174
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:38,279
<i>... reveal nothing to Captain Fache.</i>

175
00:15:38,586 --> 00:15:40,577
<i>You are in grave danger.</i>

176
00:15:54,018 --> 00:15:55,451
Church of Saint-Sulpice.

177
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:57,282
<i>Good evening, Sister.</i>

178
00:15:58,397 --> 00:16:02,026
<i>I need you to show someone</i>
<i>our church tonight.</i>

179
00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:03,962
Of course, Father.

180
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:06,161
But so late?

181
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:08,444
Wouldn't tomorrow?

182
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:13,214
<i>This is a request from an</i>
<i>important bishop of Opus Dei.</i>

183
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:16,471
It would be my pleasure.

184
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:43,433
There's been an accident. A friend.

185
00:16:43,774 --> 00:16:45,685
I have to fly home in the morning.

186
00:16:45,984 --> 00:16:47,178
I see.

187
00:16:47,444 --> 00:16:51,323
Is there a restroom I could use? I just
wanna splash some water on my face.

188
00:16:51,698 --> 00:16:52,813
Yes.

189
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:58,144
She said it is meaningless.

190
00:16:58,621 --> 00:17:00,339
Mathematical joke.

191
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,168
Is it meaningless?

192
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,831
I'll take another look
when I come back.

193
00:17:11,842 --> 00:17:14,151
I'm sorry. Of course.

194
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:30,182
Do you have a message
from Saunière?

195
00:17:30,986 --> 00:17:32,544
What are you talking about?

196
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,133
Crazy old man.

197
00:17:35,406 --> 00:17:38,478
You have me confused with
someone else. I came here to...

198
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:40,225
Check your jacket pocket.

199
00:17:41,621 --> 00:17:42,849
Just look.

200
00:17:47,293 --> 00:17:48,567
GPS tracking dot.

201
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:51,794
Accurate within two feet
anywhere on the globe.

202
00:17:52,131 --> 00:17:55,521
The agent who picked you up
slipped it into your jacket...

203
00:17:57,136 --> 00:17:59,092
...in case you tried to run.

204
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:03,278
We have you on a little leash,
professor.

205
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,875
Why would I try to run?
I didn't do anything.

206
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:09,781
So, what do you think about
the fourth line of text...

207
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:12,867
...Fache wiped clean
before you arrived?

208
00:18:18,907 --> 00:18:22,820
He brought you here to force a
confession, Professor Langdon.

209
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,924
He's still in there?
What's he doing?

210
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,447
Fache isn't even looking
for other suspects, okay?

211
00:18:32,837 --> 00:18:34,236
He is sure you're guilty.

212
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:40,434
When did Saunière contact you?

213
00:18:40,761 --> 00:18:41,750
- Today?
- Yes, yes.

214
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:43,968
What time? What time?

215
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:46,141
At 3. Around 3. Three.

216
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:50,028
We call Fache "the Bull."
Once he starts, he doesn't stop.

217
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,512
He can arrest you and detain you
for months while he builds a case.

218
00:18:53,857 --> 00:18:57,054
And by then whatever Saunière
wanted you to tell me will be useless.

219
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,393
Stop it! Just stop!

220
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:01,428
Who are you?

221
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:08,249
Look at the letters.

222
00:19:09,622 --> 00:19:10,691
"P.S."

223
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:13,091
P.S., postscript.

224
00:19:14,585 --> 00:19:16,940
"Princesse Sophie." Silly, I know.

225
00:19:17,254 --> 00:19:19,973
But I was only a girl
when I lived with him.

226
00:19:23,552 --> 00:19:25,941
Jacques Saunière
was my grandfather.

227
00:19:31,268 --> 00:19:34,419
Apparently, it was his dying wish
that we meet.

228
00:19:36,397 --> 00:19:38,467
If you help me understand why...

229
00:19:38,775 --> 00:19:42,290
...I will get you to your embassy,
where we cannot arrest you.

230
00:19:43,738 --> 00:19:46,252
Fache was never gonna let me
just stroll out of here, was he?

231
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:48,515
No.

232
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,959
If we are to get away from here,
we must find another way.

233
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:04,197
What exactly do you propose?

234
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,523
Saunière was reading his book.

235
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:18,934
"Blood trail."

236
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:22,783
Excuse me, captain.

237
00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:25,028
We have a problem.

238
00:20:25,361 --> 00:20:28,159
Headquarters didn't send
Sophie Neveu.

239
00:20:30,574 --> 00:20:31,689
What?

240
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:35,148
Captain, look at this.

241
00:20:36,956 --> 00:20:38,105
He jumped!

242
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:39,780
Shit.

243
00:20:42,044 --> 00:20:45,002
<i>He's moving again. And fast.</i>

244
00:20:45,922 --> 00:20:47,594
He must be in a car.

245
00:20:49,134 --> 00:20:53,047
<i>He's going south</i>
<i>on Pont du Carrousel.</i>

246
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:03,215
Bastard.

247
00:21:26,878 --> 00:21:29,790
That cop will check
the whole lower floor.

248
00:21:33,552 --> 00:21:35,747
I will only take a moment.

249
00:21:36,388 --> 00:21:37,582
Of course.

250
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:48,346
He is much older than I remember.

251
00:22:00,244 --> 00:22:03,520
I hadn't seen or spoken to him
in a very long time.

252
00:22:12,756 --> 00:22:16,544
He phoned my office today.
Several times.

253
00:22:17,927 --> 00:22:20,805
He said it was a matter
of life and death.

254
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:24,669
I thought it was another trick
to get back in touch.

255
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,103
It seems when
he couldn't speak to me...

256
00:22:31,357 --> 00:22:33,268
...he reached out to you.

257
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:52,772
- Wait a minute.
- Professor?

258
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:57,788
This is wrong.
Yeah. See? This is wrong.

259
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:02,937
The Fibonacci numbers only
make sense when they're in order.

260
00:23:03,304 --> 00:23:04,703
These are scrambled.

261
00:23:04,973 --> 00:23:08,522
If he was trying to reach out,
maybe he was doing it in code.

262
00:23:08,893 --> 00:23:10,690
Would you hold this, please?

263
00:23:12,897 --> 00:23:14,933
This phrase is meaningless.

264
00:23:17,193 --> 00:23:21,471
Unless you assume these letters
are out of order too.

265
00:23:21,864 --> 00:23:22,979
An anagram.

266
00:23:34,793 --> 00:23:36,465
You have eidetic memory?

267
00:23:36,878 --> 00:23:40,268
Not quite. But I can pretty much
remember what I see.

268
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:03,650
Anagram is right.

269
00:24:05,155 --> 00:24:07,589
"O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint"
becomes:

270
00:24:07,908 --> 00:24:10,422
"Leonardo da Vinci.
The <i>Mona Lisa."</i>

271
00:24:10,744 --> 00:24:14,259
Professor, the <i>Mona Lisa</i>
is right over here.

272
00:24:20,795 --> 00:24:25,505
Look at this. He must have
thrown it from the window.

273
00:24:26,092 --> 00:24:27,605
Smart to hit the truck.

274
00:24:28,094 --> 00:24:31,450
What, you admire him now?

275
00:24:33,224 --> 00:24:35,215
We're stupid.
Who did we leave at the museum?

276
00:24:35,518 --> 00:24:38,078
Ledoux? Get him on the radio!

277
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:41,520
Her smile is in
the lower spatial frequencies.

278
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:45,293
The horizon is significantly lower
on the left than it is on the right.

279
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:46,641
Why?

280
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:50,055
Well, see, she appears larger
from the left than on the right.

281
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:53,319
Historically, the left was female,
the right was male.

282
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,332
There. Blood.

283
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:04,822
Hey.

284
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:09,103
"So dark the con of man."

285
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,160
No. It doesn't say that.

286
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,662
Is it another anagram?
Can you break it?

287
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,124
Professor, hurry. Hurry!

288
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,696
Moon. Sermon. Charms.

289
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,860
Demons. Omens. Codes.
Monks. Ranks. Rocks.

290
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,228
<i>Madonna of the Rocks.</i>

291
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,105
Da Vinci.

292
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,223
Careful. Careful.

293
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,435
This can't be this. The fleur-de-lis.

294
00:26:38,469 --> 00:26:40,061
It was Saunière's.

295
00:26:40,763 --> 00:26:43,561
I remember finding it once
when I was a girl.

296
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:46,674
He'd promised
he'd give it to me one day.

297
00:26:47,603 --> 00:26:49,719
Have you ever heard
those words before, Sophie?

298
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:51,341
"So dark the con of man"?

299
00:26:51,606 --> 00:26:53,119
No. Have you?

300
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,676
When you were a child, were you
aware of any secret gatherings?

301
00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:00,259
Anything ritualistic in nature?

302
00:27:00,573 --> 00:27:03,690
<i>Meetings your grandfather</i>
<i>would've wanted kept secret?</i>

303
00:27:04,035 --> 00:27:07,345
Was there ever any talk of something
called the Priory of Sion?

304
00:27:07,705 --> 00:27:10,503
The what? Why are you
asking these things?

305
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:13,188
The Priory of Sion is a myth.

306
00:27:13,502 --> 00:27:17,780
One of the world's oldest and most
secret societies, with leaders like...

307
00:27:18,174 --> 00:27:20,563
...Sir Isaac Newton,
da Vinci himself.

308
00:27:21,093 --> 00:27:22,811
The fleur-de-lis is their crest.

309
00:27:23,095 --> 00:27:25,529
They're guardians of a secret
they supposedly refer to...

310
00:27:25,848 --> 00:27:27,884
...as "the dark con of man."

311
00:27:28,642 --> 00:27:29,961
But what secret?

312
00:27:30,561 --> 00:27:35,635
The Priory of Sion protects
the source of God's power on earth.

313
00:27:44,824 --> 00:27:46,621
I can't do this by myself.

314
00:27:47,243 --> 00:27:50,041
I'm in enough trouble as it is.
That's my embassy.

315
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:51,406
Please.

316
00:27:51,664 --> 00:27:53,063
Even if we could get out of this...

317
00:27:53,332 --> 00:27:54,765
Okay.

318
00:28:31,035 --> 00:28:34,311
No, no, no. You're not gonna make it.
You're not gonna make it!

319
00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:43,357
Well, that was...

320
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:54,141
We need to get out of sight.

321
00:29:08,696 --> 00:29:10,846
Christ, give me strength.

322
00:29:23,502 --> 00:29:27,290
You are a ghost.

323
00:29:28,882 --> 00:29:31,032
Christ, give me strength.

324
00:30:08,462 --> 00:30:10,930
Stealing in a house of God!

325
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:26,313
You are an angel.

326
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,806
Christ, give me strength.

327
00:30:56,383 --> 00:30:58,453
You have powerful friends.

328
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:02,253
Bishop Aringarosa
has been kind to me.

329
00:31:03,014 --> 00:31:06,848
I could not miss this chance
to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice.

330
00:31:07,894 --> 00:31:10,249
A pity you couldn't wait for morning.

331
00:31:10,563 --> 00:31:12,440
The light is not ideal.

332
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:17,358
Tell me, Sister, please,
of the Rose Line.

333
00:31:17,945 --> 00:31:22,894
A rose line is any line that goes from
the North to South Poles.

334
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:28,035
Set into the streets of Paris,
135 brass markers...

335
00:31:28,455 --> 00:31:30,844
...mark the world's
first prime meridian...

336
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:33,475
...which passed through
this very church.

337
00:31:33,794 --> 00:31:35,546
It hides beneath the Rose.

338
00:31:35,837 --> 00:31:36,986
I'm sorry?

339
00:31:38,298 --> 00:31:39,492
Sister.

340
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,411
I do not want to keep you.
I will show myself out.

341
00:31:48,766 --> 00:31:49,835
I insist.

342
00:31:54,147 --> 00:31:56,945
May the peace of the Lord
be with you.

343
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:00,304
And with you.

344
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:18,565
They found Neveu's car
abandoned at the train station.

345
00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:24,259
And two tickets to Brussels paid for
with Langdon's credit card.

346
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,112
A decoy, I'm sure.

347
00:32:26,428 --> 00:32:28,703
All the same,
send an officer to the station.

348
00:32:29,097 --> 00:32:31,565
Question all the taxi drivers.
I'll put this on the wire.

349
00:32:31,975 --> 00:32:34,614
Interpol? We're not sure he's guilty.

350
00:32:35,103 --> 00:32:38,652
I know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt.

351
00:32:39,065 --> 00:32:41,863
Robert Langdon is guilty.

352
00:32:50,617 --> 00:32:52,175
This is the Bois de Boulogne?

353
00:32:52,453 --> 00:32:55,172
We should be safe in this park
for a few minutes.

354
00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:48,441
Stay here.

355
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:51,361
Police.

356
00:33:52,969 --> 00:33:54,197
What do you want?

357
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,727
Fifty euros for all your stuff.

358
00:34:04,146 --> 00:34:06,137
Go and get something to eat.

359
00:34:26,084 --> 00:34:27,995
Did it occur to you
that could be dangerous?

360
00:34:28,294 --> 00:34:31,366
No. And now we have
a place to think.

361
00:34:32,006 --> 00:34:33,644
Any ideas, professor?

362
00:34:34,926 --> 00:34:38,316
You could've just handed me
a piece of a UFO from Area 51.

363
00:34:40,973 --> 00:34:42,964
"What's the next step?"

364
00:34:43,267 --> 00:34:44,825
With him, it's always:

365
00:34:45,102 --> 00:34:48,060
"Sophie, what's the next step?"

366
00:34:48,939 --> 00:34:50,213
Puzzles.

367
00:34:50,482 --> 00:34:51,756
Codes.

368
00:34:52,776 --> 00:34:53,891
A treasure hunt.

369
00:34:58,365 --> 00:34:59,559
To find his killer.

370
00:35:03,912 --> 00:35:07,143
Maybe there is something
about this Priory of Sion.

371
00:35:07,499 --> 00:35:08,454
I hope not.

372
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:13,343
Any Priory story ends in bloodshed.
They were butchered by the Church.

373
00:35:13,963 --> 00:35:17,000
<i>It all started over a thousand</i>
<i>years ago when a French king...</i>

374
00:35:17,341 --> 00:35:19,650
<i>... conquered the holy city</i>
<i>of Jerusalem.</i>

375
00:35:19,969 --> 00:35:23,120
<i>This crusade, one of the most</i>
<i>massive and sweeping in history...</i>

376
00:35:23,472 --> 00:35:26,828
...was actually orchestrated
by a secret brotherhood...

377
00:35:27,184 --> 00:35:28,458
...the Priory of Sion...

378
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:32,640
...and their military arm,
the Knights Templar.

379
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:36,144
But the Templars were created
to protect the Holy Land.

380
00:35:36,485 --> 00:35:40,319
That was a cover to hide their
true goal, according to this myth.

381
00:35:40,989 --> 00:35:44,026
<i>Supposedly the invasion</i>
<i>was to find an artifact...</i>

382
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:46,119
<i>... lost since the time of Christ.</i>

383
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:50,370
<i>An artifact, it was said,</i>
<i>the Church would kill to possess.</i>

384
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:53,216
Did they find it,
this buried treasure?

385
00:35:54,544 --> 00:35:55,772
Put it this way:

386
00:35:56,045 --> 00:35:58,798
One day the Templars
simply stopped searching.

387
00:35:59,132 --> 00:36:02,442
<i>They quit the Holy Land</i>
<i>and traveled directly to Rome.</i>

388
00:36:02,802 --> 00:36:04,599
<i>Whether they blackmailed</i>
<i>the papacy...</i>

389
00:36:04,887 --> 00:36:07,162
<i>... or the Church bought their silence,</i>
<i>no one knows.</i>

390
00:36:07,473 --> 00:36:11,671
<i>But it is a fact the papacy</i>
<i>declared these Priory knights...</i>

391
00:36:12,061 --> 00:36:15,531
<i>... these Knights Templar,</i>
<i>of limitless power.</i>

392
00:36:16,315 --> 00:36:19,512
<i>By the 1300s, the Templars</i>
<i>had grown too powerful.</i>

393
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,179
<i>Too threatening.</i>

394
00:36:21,611 --> 00:36:23,602
<i>So the Vatican</i>
<i>issued secret orders...</i>

395
00:36:23,905 --> 00:36:26,703
<i>... to be opened simultaneously</i>
<i>all across Europe.</i>

396
00:36:27,575 --> 00:36:31,409
<i>The Pope had declared the</i>
<i>Knights Templar Satan worshipers...</i>

397
00:36:31,788 --> 00:36:36,145
...and said God had charged him with
cleansing the earth of these heretics.

398
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:38,851
The plan went off like clockwork.

399
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:42,003
<i>The Templars</i>
<i>were all but exterminated.</i>

400
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:46,379
<i>The date was October 13th, 1307.</i>
<i>A Friday.</i>

401
00:36:46,761 --> 00:36:48,592
<i>Friday the 13th.</i>

402
00:36:48,929 --> 00:36:51,807
<i>The Pope sent troops</i>
<i>to claim the Priory's treasure...</i>

403
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:53,654
<i>... but they found nothing.</i>

404
00:36:53,934 --> 00:36:57,051
<i>The few surviving</i>
<i>Knights of the Priory had vanished...</i>

405
00:36:57,396 --> 00:37:00,115
<i>... and the search for their</i>
<i>sacred artifact began again.</i>

406
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,399
What artifact? I've never
heard about any of this.

407
00:37:04,778 --> 00:37:06,211
Yes, you have.

408
00:37:06,655 --> 00:37:08,930
Almost everyone on earth has.

409
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:12,407
You just know it as the Holy Grail.

410
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:22,125
Please, Saunière thought he knew
the location of the Holy Grail?

411
00:37:22,712 --> 00:37:24,509
Maybe more than that.

412
00:37:24,797 --> 00:37:28,551
This cross and the flower,
this could be very old. But look.

413
00:37:28,926 --> 00:37:33,920
This metal here underneath is much
newer, and there's a modern ID stamp.

414
00:37:34,348 --> 00:37:36,145
"Haxo 24."

415
00:37:38,185 --> 00:37:41,416
And these dots.
These dots are read by a laser.

416
00:37:41,772 --> 00:37:45,287
This is more than a pendant.
This is a key your grandfather left you.

417
00:37:45,817 --> 00:37:48,172
He left us, professor.

418
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:53,848
And <i>vingt-quatre</i> Haxo,
it's not an ID stamp.

419
00:37:54,701 --> 00:37:56,498
It's a street address.

420
00:38:01,457 --> 00:38:02,936
<i>This is Jacques Saunière.</i>

421
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:06,090
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>after the tone.</i>

422
00:38:06,962 --> 00:38:09,192
Please, Monsieur Saunière,
pick up the phone.

423
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,989
This is Sandrine Bieil.

424
00:38:11,342 --> 00:38:13,458
I have called the list.

425
00:38:14,011 --> 00:38:15,808
I fear the other guardians are dead.

426
00:38:16,513 --> 00:38:18,310
The lie has been told.

427
00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:20,562
The floor panel has been broken.

428
00:38:21,351 --> 00:38:24,582
Please, monsieur, pick up the phone.
I beg you.

429
00:38:24,938 --> 00:38:27,054
Job 38, verse 11.

430
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,231
Do you know it, Sister?

431
00:38:31,945 --> 00:38:33,583
Job 38:11.

432
00:38:35,365 --> 00:38:37,481
Hitherto shalt thou come...

433
00:38:38,451 --> 00:38:40,089
...but no further.

434
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:41,688
"But no further."

435
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:47,672
Do you mock me?

436
00:38:50,838 --> 00:38:52,874
Where is the keystone?

437
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:55,437
I do not know.

438
00:38:56,552 --> 00:38:57,621
No.

439
00:39:00,013 --> 00:39:02,607
You are a sister of the Church...

440
00:39:04,726 --> 00:39:07,957
...and yet you serve them:
the Priory.

441
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:12,147
Jesus had but one true message.
That...

442
00:39:25,371 --> 00:39:27,931
Come, you saints of God.

443
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,467
Hasten, angels of the Lord.

444
00:39:32,378 --> 00:39:34,972
To receive her soul.

445
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:39,901
And bring her to the sight
of the Almighty.

446
00:39:58,778 --> 00:40:00,336
Welcome, bishop.

447
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,191
This council is convened.

448
00:40:11,874 --> 00:40:15,264
Our words shall never
pass these walls.

449
00:40:18,255 --> 00:40:19,847
What business, say you?

450
00:40:21,967 --> 00:40:24,276
As you know, my request for funds...

451
00:40:24,594 --> 00:40:27,791
Yes, 20 million euro
in untraceable bearer bonds.

452
00:40:28,765 --> 00:40:32,280
A tad more than petty cash.
Wouldn't you say, bishop?

453
00:40:33,728 --> 00:40:38,165
I only offer a route to the renewal
of faith for all men.

454
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:39,760
How humble.

455
00:40:40,026 --> 00:40:42,699
Our savior, Bishop Aringarosa.

456
00:40:43,029 --> 00:40:44,508
How dare you presume to...

457
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,498
I do not presume, I act!

458
00:40:46,782 --> 00:40:48,852
The Vatican's unwillingness
to support us...

459
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,673
...is both impious and cowardly.

460
00:40:50,953 --> 00:40:54,912
Blood is being spilled because true
Christian values lie in ruins. No more!

461
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:58,825
This council has forgotten
its very purpose.

462
00:41:01,672 --> 00:41:02,741
Tonight...

463
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,149
...the Grail will be destroyed.

464
00:41:06,468 --> 00:41:10,222
The Priory's few remaining members
will be silenced.

465
00:41:18,354 --> 00:41:22,393
I was contacted by a man
who calls himself only "the Teacher."

466
00:41:25,111 --> 00:41:27,545
<i>Two prostitutes identified</i>
<i>Langdon and Neveu...</i>

467
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:29,933
<i>... getting into a taxi</i>
<i>in the Bois de Boulogne.</i>

468
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:41,748
Because of your expertise?

469
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:44,444
- I'm sorry?
- About the Priory.

470
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:47,022
Do you think that's why
Saunière sought you out?

471
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:50,708
I can think of dozens of scholars
who know a lot more about it.

472
00:41:51,052 --> 00:41:54,931
Actually, I didn't think
he liked me very much.

473
00:41:55,765 --> 00:41:59,041
Once made a joke at my expense.
Got a big laugh out of it.

474
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:00,668
What was it?

475
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:15,663
How may I help you?

476
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:23,815
The door to the right, please.

477
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,949
Good evening. I am André Vernet,
the night manager.

478
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:49,678
I take it this is your first visit
to our establishment?

479
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:51,564
Yes.

480
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,798
Understood.

481
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,888
Keys are often passed on
and first-time users...

482
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,759
...are sometimes
uncertain of protocol.

483
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,578
Keys are essentially
numbered Swiss accounts.

484
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,472
Often willed through generations.

485
00:43:11,546 --> 00:43:13,855
Is it yours, mademoiselle?

486
00:43:16,134 --> 00:43:18,967
The shortest safety-deposit-box
lease is 50 years.

487
00:43:20,138 --> 00:43:22,094
And what's your longest account?

488
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:23,869
Quite a bit longer.

489
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:26,948
Technologies change,
keys are updated.

490
00:43:32,483 --> 00:43:34,041
Once the computer
confirms your key...

491
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:37,549
...enter your account number
and your box is retrieved.

492
00:43:38,155 --> 00:43:40,464
The room is yours,
as long as you like.

493
00:43:45,662 --> 00:43:48,734
What if I lost track
of my account number?

494
00:43:49,332 --> 00:43:50,731
How might I recover it?

495
00:43:53,086 --> 00:43:55,520
I'm afraid each key is paired
with a 10-digit number...

496
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,795
...known only to the account bearer.

497
00:43:58,091 --> 00:44:00,047
I hope you manage to remember it.

498
00:44:00,802 --> 00:44:03,316
A single wrong entry
disables the system.

499
00:44:10,353 --> 00:44:11,342
- Ten.
- Ten.

500
00:44:11,604 --> 00:44:14,038
Your grandfather's
Fibonacci sequence.

501
00:44:17,318 --> 00:44:19,548
Scrambled, unscrambled?

502
00:44:20,612 --> 00:44:21,840
Unscrambled.

503
00:44:22,614 --> 00:44:24,172
It's your key.

504
00:44:28,995 --> 00:44:32,510
Funny, I don't even like history.

505
00:44:35,835 --> 00:44:40,147
I've never seen much good come
from looking to the past.

506
00:44:47,805 --> 00:44:49,238
Moment of truth.

507
00:45:33,933 --> 00:45:36,367
My God. I don't believe this.

508
00:45:36,936 --> 00:45:38,005
A rose.

509
00:45:42,941 --> 00:45:44,659
The rose was a symbol
for the Holy Grail.

510
00:45:47,613 --> 00:45:49,126
Forgive the intrusion.

511
00:45:49,406 --> 00:45:52,796
I'm afraid the police arrived
more quickly than I anticipated.

512
00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:55,624
You must follow me, please.

513
00:45:55,912 --> 00:45:57,186
For your own safety.

514
00:45:57,622 --> 00:45:59,180
You knew they were coming?

515
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:02,051
My guard alerted me to your status
when you arrived.

516
00:46:02,377 --> 00:46:05,130
Yours is one of our oldest
and highest-level accounts.

517
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:07,579
It includes a safe-passage clause.

518
00:46:07,882 --> 00:46:08,997
Safe passage?

519
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:13,755
If you would step inside, please.
Time is of the essence.

520
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:17,535
In there?

521
00:46:32,781 --> 00:46:34,453
Hey, is there a problem?

522
00:46:34,783 --> 00:46:37,251
Good evening, sir. Police.

523
00:46:37,827 --> 00:46:41,740
I just drive from here to Zurich.
Not French, English?

524
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:43,359
- English?
- Yes.

525
00:46:44,834 --> 00:46:47,348
We are looking for two criminals.

526
00:46:48,671 --> 00:46:51,424
You came to the right place.
They're all criminals here.

527
00:46:53,342 --> 00:46:55,572
Would you mind opening the hold?

528
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:59,610
Please. You think they trust us,
the wages I get paid?

529
00:46:59,974 --> 00:47:01,726
You don't have keys
to your own truck?

530
00:47:02,017 --> 00:47:04,611
It's armored.
Keys get sent to the destination.

531
00:47:04,937 --> 00:47:06,893
You mind? I'm on a schedule here.

532
00:47:10,525 --> 00:47:14,757
And do all the drivers wear a Rolex?

533
00:47:15,447 --> 00:47:16,436
What?

534
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,429
This piece of shit.

535
00:47:20,702 --> 00:47:22,374
Forty euros in Barbès.

536
00:47:22,662 --> 00:47:23,731
Yours for 35.

537
00:47:24,372 --> 00:47:25,327
No, no, no.

538
00:47:25,581 --> 00:47:27,253
- Thirty.
- No. It's okay, it's okay.

539
00:47:27,542 --> 00:47:28,736
Come on, 30, eh?

540
00:47:29,001 --> 00:47:30,275
I said, no!

541
00:47:30,878 --> 00:47:31,947
Move along!

542
00:47:45,392 --> 00:47:46,461
Now we wait.

543
00:47:46,727 --> 00:47:49,241
The Teacher will call and tell me
where to deliver the money.

544
00:47:49,563 --> 00:47:52,760
You have put tremendous faith
in this Teacher of yours.

545
00:47:53,108 --> 00:47:57,340
Yes, I have. And I have given him
an angel to do his will.

546
00:47:57,904 --> 00:48:01,101
For surely there is no better
soldier for God than my Silas.

547
00:48:02,325 --> 00:48:05,840
I firmly resolve, with the help of
thy grace, to confess my sins...

548
00:48:06,245 --> 00:48:10,796
...to do penance
and to amend my life.

549
00:48:11,292 --> 00:48:12,247
Amen.

550
00:48:27,766 --> 00:48:29,324
The Holy Grail.

551
00:48:30,185 --> 00:48:34,815
A magic cup.
The source of God's power on earth.

552
00:48:35,232 --> 00:48:36,460
It's nonsense.

553
00:48:37,484 --> 00:48:39,315
You don't believe in God.

554
00:48:40,278 --> 00:48:41,347
No.

555
00:48:42,447 --> 00:48:43,846
Just people.

556
00:48:44,616 --> 00:48:47,289
Sometimes that they can be kind.

557
00:48:49,203 --> 00:48:51,637
Are you a God-fearing man,
professor?

558
00:48:52,873 --> 00:48:54,591
I was raised a Catholic.

559
00:48:55,376 --> 00:48:57,810
Well, that's not really an answer.

560
00:48:59,797 --> 00:49:01,674
Professor, are you okay?

561
00:49:02,925 --> 00:49:04,438
Go ahead, open it.

562
00:49:05,302 --> 00:49:06,291
Go on.

563
00:49:13,477 --> 00:49:14,705
A cryptex.

564
00:49:16,146 --> 00:49:18,501
They are used to keep secrets.

565
00:49:19,399 --> 00:49:21,435
It's da Vinci's design.

566
00:49:22,152 --> 00:49:25,303
You write the information
on a papyrus scroll...

567
00:49:25,655 --> 00:49:30,570
...which is then rolled around
a thin glass vial of vinegar.

568
00:49:30,993 --> 00:49:34,030
If you force it open, the vial breaks...

569
00:49:34,372 --> 00:49:36,932
...vinegar dissolves papyrus...

570
00:49:38,834 --> 00:49:41,268
...and your secret is lost forever.

571
00:49:41,795 --> 00:49:43,706
The only way
to access the information...

572
00:49:44,006 --> 00:49:46,281
...is to spell out the password...

573
00:49:46,592 --> 00:49:49,902
...with these five dials,
each with 26 letters.

574
00:49:50,971 --> 00:49:54,486
That's 12 million possibilities.

575
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:58,786
I've never met a girl
who knew that much about a cryptex.

576
00:50:00,188 --> 00:50:02,338
Saunière made one for me once.

577
00:50:10,364 --> 00:50:13,436
My grandfather gave me a wagon.

578
00:50:16,162 --> 00:50:18,312
This clearly is not the Holy Grail.

579
00:50:22,334 --> 00:50:23,449
Come on.

580
00:50:23,752 --> 00:50:25,151
Please, you're not all right.

581
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:30,262
May I try something?

582
00:50:30,717 --> 00:50:32,548
I don't know why it works.

583
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,690
My mother used to do it
when I was scared, I think.

584
00:50:37,182 --> 00:50:38,376
You think?

585
00:50:39,225 --> 00:50:40,294
Yes.

586
00:50:52,363 --> 00:50:54,115
Feeling better, Sophie?

587
00:51:06,043 --> 00:51:10,639
My parents died in a car crash
with my brother.

588
00:51:11,798 --> 00:51:13,072
I was 4.

589
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,329
I'm sorry.

590
00:51:17,762 --> 00:51:19,593
It was many years ago.

591
00:51:35,321 --> 00:51:36,515
Better?

592
00:51:39,325 --> 00:51:40,280
Yeah.

593
00:51:41,118 --> 00:51:42,187
Okay.

594
00:52:08,478 --> 00:52:10,946
Twenty years waiting
for someone to come for that box...

595
00:52:11,272 --> 00:52:13,661
...and now it's you two murderers.
Bring it to me.

596
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:16,201
I don't know what
you're talking about.

597
00:52:17,486 --> 00:52:19,363
All right! Okay!

598
00:52:20,114 --> 00:52:21,069
Right now!

599
00:52:31,583 --> 00:52:32,538
Step back!

600
00:52:36,546 --> 00:52:38,855
No one will lose sleep
over a couple on a killing spree.

601
00:52:42,177 --> 00:52:43,610
Turn around.

602
00:52:44,888 --> 00:52:46,241
Turn around!

603
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:48,231
You too, mademoiselle.

604
00:53:10,913 --> 00:53:12,346
Sophie!

605
00:53:12,873 --> 00:53:14,192
Get in the truck!

606
00:53:15,083 --> 00:53:16,357
I'll drive! Hurry!

607
00:53:45,654 --> 00:53:50,170
What happened between you
and your grandfather, exactly?

608
00:53:51,243 --> 00:53:54,918
I've jammed my shoulder,
I've been shot at, I'm bleeding.

609
00:53:55,288 --> 00:53:56,801
I need to know.

610
00:53:57,082 --> 00:54:00,392
You say he raised you,
but you two don't talk anymore.

611
00:54:00,752 --> 00:54:02,629
You call him by his last name.

612
00:54:03,004 --> 00:54:05,438
You say you hate history.

613
00:54:05,757 --> 00:54:07,952
Nobody hates history.
They hate their own histories.

614
00:54:08,259 --> 00:54:10,136
So now you're a psychologist too?

615
00:54:10,595 --> 00:54:14,634
What if Saunière had started
to groom you for the Priory?

616
00:54:15,016 --> 00:54:16,608
What do you mean, groom me?

617
00:54:16,893 --> 00:54:19,851
Your grandfather gave you puzzles
and cryptex as a child.

618
00:54:20,187 --> 00:54:23,896
So you are saying all this is real?
The Priory, the Holy Grail?

619
00:54:24,275 --> 00:54:27,267
We've been dragged into a world
of people who think this stuff is real.

620
00:54:27,611 --> 00:54:29,806
- Real enough to kill for.
- Who?

621
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:38,553
I'm out of my field here.

622
00:54:41,124 --> 00:54:45,561
I do know a Grail historian,
absolutely obsessed with Priory myth.

623
00:54:45,962 --> 00:54:48,954
An Englishman,
lives here in France.

624
00:54:49,299 --> 00:54:50,857
Do you trust this man?

625
00:54:52,051 --> 00:54:53,530
I hope you can.

626
00:54:59,725 --> 00:55:01,443
Vernet, André.

627
00:55:03,229 --> 00:55:05,902
It seems you're not a driver at all.

628
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:12,451
Apparently, you lost your tongue
along with your truck.

629
00:55:13,322 --> 00:55:15,882
You think you're in pain now,
André Vernet?

630
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:20,238
My cause is worth your life.
Understand?

631
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:26,270
What do you want?

632
00:55:26,668 --> 00:55:31,662
Your truck carries a homing device.
Activate it.

633
00:55:39,597 --> 00:55:42,191
<i>Please wait.</i>
<i>I'll see if he's available.</i>

634
00:55:42,516 --> 00:55:44,074
It's on the wrong side.

635
00:55:44,351 --> 00:55:46,706
Leigh likes all things to be English,
including his cars.

636
00:55:47,021 --> 00:55:50,013
<i>Robert! Do I owe you money?</i>

637
00:55:51,024 --> 00:55:53,697
Leigh, my friend...

638
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:57,228
...care to open up
for an old colleague?

639
00:55:57,572 --> 00:55:59,244
<i>- Of course.</i>
- Thank you.

640
00:55:59,658 --> 00:56:01,933
<i>But first, a test of honor.</i>

641
00:56:02,661 --> 00:56:04,253
<i>Three questions.</i>

642
00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:08,780
Fire away.

643
00:56:09,042 --> 00:56:10,441
<i>Your first:</i>

644
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:13,224
<i>Shall I serve coffee or tea?</i>

645
00:56:14,213 --> 00:56:15,532
Tea, of course.

646
00:56:15,798 --> 00:56:16,787
<i>Excellent.</i>

647
00:56:17,049 --> 00:56:19,244
<i>Second: milk or lemon?</i>

648
00:56:20,386 --> 00:56:21,375
Milk?

649
00:56:22,805 --> 00:56:25,000
That would depend on the tea.

650
00:56:25,307 --> 00:56:26,262
<i>Correct.</i>

651
00:56:27,309 --> 00:56:31,348
<i>And now the third</i>
<i>and most grave of inquiries:</i>

652
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:36,804
<i>In which year did a Harvard sculler</i>
<i>outrow an Oxford man at Henley?</i>

653
00:56:44,576 --> 00:56:48,125
Surely such a travesty
has never occurred.

654
00:56:48,913 --> 00:56:50,710
<i>Your heart is true.</i>

655
00:56:51,666 --> 00:56:52,985
<i>You may pass.</i>

656
00:56:54,877 --> 00:56:57,107
<i>Welcome to Château Villette.</i>

657
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:02,517
<i>The truck's signal is coming online.</i>

658
00:57:02,885 --> 00:57:04,204
It's about time.

659
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:09,570
Locked on and tracking, sir.

660
00:57:12,728 --> 00:57:15,765
Very good. Tell Collet not to move in
until I get there.

661
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,752
Attention! All of Collet's units
to Château Villette.

662
00:57:21,903 --> 00:57:25,054
<i>The suspects Neveu and Langdon</i>
<i>are likely at that location.</i>

663
00:57:41,714 --> 00:57:42,988
<i>Aringarosa.</i>

664
00:57:53,976 --> 00:57:56,888
I still don't know why
he put you into this...

665
00:57:57,729 --> 00:57:59,526
...and I'm sorry.

666
00:58:04,736 --> 00:58:05,885
But...

667
00:58:06,738 --> 00:58:08,490
...I'm also very glad.

668
00:58:26,841 --> 00:58:29,355
You are requested
to make yourself at home.

669
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:38,924
Robert!

670
00:58:40,062 --> 00:58:42,530
And you travel with a maiden,
it seems.

671
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:45,928
Sir Leigh Teabing,
may I present Miss Sophie Neveu.

672
00:58:46,276 --> 00:58:48,312
Sophie, Sir Leigh Teabing.

673
00:58:48,611 --> 00:58:52,240
It's an honor to welcome you...

674
00:58:53,032 --> 00:58:55,023
...even though it's late.

675
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:59,085
Thank you for having us.
I realize it's quite late.

676
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:03,373
So late, mademoiselle,
it's almost early.

677
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:07,728
What a lovely smile you have.

678
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,795
Earl Grey?

679
00:59:11,842 --> 00:59:12,831
Lemon.

680
00:59:13,635 --> 00:59:14,704
Correct.

681
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:37,606
Château Villette. Yes.

682
00:59:39,494 --> 00:59:41,450
A dramatic late-night arrival.

683
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:44,260
What can an old cripple
do for you, Robert?

684
00:59:45,374 --> 00:59:48,889
We wanna talk about
the Priory of Sion.

685
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:50,652
The keepers?

686
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:52,946
The secret war?

687
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,126
Sorry for all the mystery.

688
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:58,804
Leigh, I'm into something here
that I cannot understand.

689
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:00,423
You?

690
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:04,537
- Really?
- Not without your help.

691
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:08,059
Playing to my vanity, Robert.
You should be ashamed.

692
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,511
Not if it works.

693
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:14,262
There are always four:

694
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:18,145
The Grand Master
and the three <i>sénéchaux...</i>

695
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:21,765
...make up the primary
guardians of the Grail.

696
01:00:23,744 --> 01:00:25,496
Thank you, Remy.
That'll be all for now.

697
01:00:32,294 --> 01:00:35,570
The Priory's members
span our very globe itself.

698
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:40,155
Philippe de Chérisey
exposed that as a hoax in 1967.

699
01:00:40,552 --> 01:00:42,383
And that is what
they want you to believe.

700
01:00:43,305 --> 01:00:45,978
The Priory is charged
with a single task:

701
01:00:46,308 --> 01:00:49,505
To protect the greatest secret
in modern history.

702
01:00:49,853 --> 01:00:52,242
The source of God's power
on earth.

703
01:00:52,564 --> 01:00:54,077
No, that's a common
misunderstanding.

704
01:00:54,357 --> 01:00:59,067
The Priory protects the source
of the Church's power on earth:

705
01:00:59,987 --> 01:01:01,215
The Holy Grail.

706
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,381
I don't understand.

707
01:01:03,658 --> 01:01:07,617
What power? Some magic dishes?

708
01:01:08,537 --> 01:01:12,450
Robert. Has he been telling you
that the Holy Grail is a cup?

709
01:01:27,013 --> 01:01:30,688
The Good Book did not arrive
by facsimile from heaven.

710
01:01:31,601 --> 01:01:35,913
The Bible as we know it
was finally presided over by one man:

711
01:01:36,314 --> 01:01:37,952
The pagan emperor Constantine.

712
01:01:38,483 --> 01:01:40,474
I thought Constantine
was a Christian.

713
01:01:40,777 --> 01:01:43,610
Oh, hardly, no.
He was a lifelong pagan...

714
01:01:43,946 --> 01:01:46,460
...who was baptized
on his deathbed.

715
01:01:46,782 --> 01:01:49,979
Constantine was Rome's
supreme holy man.

716
01:01:50,452 --> 01:01:51,885
<i>From time immemorial...</i>

717
01:01:52,162 --> 01:01:56,394
<i>... his people had worshiped a balance</i>
<i>between nature's male deities...</i>

718
01:01:56,792 --> 01:02:00,182
...and the goddess,
or sacred feminine.

719
01:02:01,129 --> 01:02:04,519
But a growing religious turmoil
was gripping Rome.

720
01:02:05,342 --> 01:02:07,094
Three centuries earlier...

721
01:02:07,385 --> 01:02:10,218
...a young Jew named Jesus
had come along...

722
01:02:10,555 --> 01:02:12,750
...preaching love and a single God.

723
01:02:13,057 --> 01:02:16,049
Centuries after his crucifixion...

724
01:02:16,686 --> 01:02:19,246
<i>... Christ's followers</i>
<i>had grown exponentially...</i>

725
01:02:19,564 --> 01:02:22,078
<i>... and had started a religious war</i>
<i>against the pagans.</i>

726
01:02:27,279 --> 01:02:30,555
Or did the pagans commence war
against the Christians?

727
01:02:31,367 --> 01:02:34,439
Leigh, we can't be sure who began
the atrocities in that period.

728
01:02:34,787 --> 01:02:37,585
We can at least agree that the
conflict grew to such proportions...

729
01:02:37,915 --> 01:02:40,383
...that it threatened
to tear Rome in two.

730
01:02:40,709 --> 01:02:43,826
So Constantine may have been
a lifelong pagan...

731
01:02:44,171 --> 01:02:45,923
...but he was also a pragmatist.

732
01:02:46,214 --> 01:02:48,250
And in 325 anno Domini...

733
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:53,385
...he decided to unify Rome under
a single religion, Christianity.

734
01:02:53,805 --> 01:02:57,844
Christianity was on the rise.
He didn't want his empire torn apart.

735
01:02:58,226 --> 01:03:01,298
And to strengthen this new
Christian tradition...

736
01:03:01,646 --> 01:03:03,796
...Constantine held
a famous ecumenical gathering...

737
01:03:04,106 --> 01:03:06,825
...known as the Council of Nicaea.

738
01:03:07,151 --> 01:03:08,550
<i>And at this council...</i>

739
01:03:08,819 --> 01:03:13,529
<i>... the many sects of Christianity</i>
<i>debated and voted on, well...</i>

740
01:03:13,949 --> 01:03:17,658
<i>... everything, from the acceptance</i>
<i>and rejection of specific gospels...</i>

741
01:03:18,036 --> 01:03:19,515
<i>... to the date for Easter...</i>

742
01:03:19,788 --> 01:03:22,700
...to the administering
of the sacraments, and of course...

743
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:24,918
...the immortality of Jesus.

744
01:03:25,585 --> 01:03:26,734
I don't follow.

745
01:03:27,254 --> 01:03:29,722
Well, <i>ma chère,</i>
until that moment in history...

746
01:03:30,465 --> 01:03:34,856
...Jesus was viewed by many of his
followers as a mighty prophet...

747
01:03:35,261 --> 01:03:38,856
...as a great and powerful man,
but a man nevertheless.

748
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,351
A mortal man.

749
01:03:41,642 --> 01:03:42,836
Not the Son of God?

750
01:03:43,102 --> 01:03:45,411
Not even his nephew twice removed.

751
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:49,086
Constantine did not create
Jesus' divinity.

752
01:03:49,442 --> 01:03:53,230
He simply sanctioned
an already widely held idea.

753
01:03:53,612 --> 01:03:55,170
- Semantics.
- No, it's not semantics.

754
01:03:55,447 --> 01:03:58,325
You're interpreting facts
to support your own conclusions.

755
01:03:58,659 --> 01:04:03,210
Fact: For many Christians, Jesus was
mortal one day and divine the next.

756
01:04:03,622 --> 01:04:05,533
For some Christians,
his divinity was enhanced.

757
01:04:05,832 --> 01:04:08,187
Absurd. There was a formal
announcement of his promotion.

758
01:04:08,502 --> 01:04:10,379
They couldn't even agree
on the Nicene Creed!

759
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:13,946
Excuse me.
"Who is God, who is man?"

760
01:04:18,469 --> 01:04:21,188
How many have been murdered
over this question?

761
01:04:22,098 --> 01:04:24,896
As long as there has been
a one true God...

762
01:04:25,226 --> 01:04:27,296
...there has been killing
in his name.

763
01:04:35,986 --> 01:04:38,454
Now let me show you the Grail.

764
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,760
I trust you recognize
<i>The Last Supper...</i>

765
01:04:44,453 --> 01:04:48,287
...the great fresco by
Leonardo da Vinci.

766
01:04:50,834 --> 01:04:53,348
Now, my dear,
if you would close your eyes.

767
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:55,786
Oh, Leigh, save us the parlor tricks.

768
01:04:56,089 --> 01:04:58,319
You asked for my help, I recall.

769
01:04:58,633 --> 01:05:01,147
Allow an old man his indulgences.

770
01:05:05,556 --> 01:05:08,832
Now, mademoiselle,
where is Jesus sitting?

771
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:11,198
- In the middle.
- Good.

772
01:05:11,479 --> 01:05:14,198
He and his disciples
are breaking bread.

773
01:05:14,523 --> 01:05:16,798
And what drink?

774
01:05:17,276 --> 01:05:19,073
Wine. They drank wine.

775
01:05:19,361 --> 01:05:21,556
Splendid. And one final question:

776
01:05:21,864 --> 01:05:24,742
How many wineglasses
are there on the table?

777
01:05:26,243 --> 01:05:28,040
One? The Holy Grail?

778
01:05:28,328 --> 01:05:29,283
Open your eyes.

779
01:05:32,332 --> 01:05:33,890
No single cup.

780
01:05:34,542 --> 01:05:35,691
No chalice.

781
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,599
Well, that's a bit strange, isn't it?

782
01:05:38,922 --> 01:05:41,880
Considering both the Bible
and standard Grail legend...

783
01:05:42,216 --> 01:05:46,334
...celebrate this moment as the
definitive arrival of the Holy Grail.

784
01:05:49,265 --> 01:05:51,699
Now, Robert,
you could be of help to us.

785
01:05:52,017 --> 01:05:55,726
If you'd be so kind as to show us the
symbols for man and woman, please.

786
01:05:56,105 --> 01:05:59,654
No balloon animals.
I can make a great duck.

787
01:06:02,861 --> 01:06:06,820
This is the original icon for male.
It's a rudimentary phallus.

788
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:09,235
- Quite to the point.
- Yes, indeed.

789
01:06:09,534 --> 01:06:11,490
This is known as the blade.

790
01:06:11,786 --> 01:06:13,583
It represents aggression
and manhood.

791
01:06:13,872 --> 01:06:16,511
It's a symbol still used today
in modern military uniforms.

792
01:06:16,833 --> 01:06:20,712
Yes, the more penises you have, the
higher your rank. Boys will be boys.

793
01:06:21,087 --> 01:06:25,205
Now, as you would imagine, the
female symbol is its exact opposite.

794
01:06:25,591 --> 01:06:26,944
This is called the chalice.

795
01:06:27,218 --> 01:06:31,814
And the chalice resembles a cup
or vessel or, more importantly...

796
01:06:32,223 --> 01:06:34,293
...the shape of a woman's womb.

797
01:06:35,601 --> 01:06:38,434
No, the Grail has never been a cup.

798
01:06:38,771 --> 01:06:43,526
It is quite literally this ancient
symbol of womanhood.

799
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:49,775
And in this case, a woman who
carried a secret so powerful...

800
01:06:50,198 --> 01:06:54,316
...that if revealed, it would devastate
the very foundations of Christianity.

801
01:06:54,703 --> 01:06:55,897
Wait, please.

802
01:06:56,162 --> 01:07:00,553
You're saying the Holy Grail
is a person? A woman?

803
01:07:01,542 --> 01:07:05,330
And it turns out, she makes
an appearance right there.

804
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:07,688
But they are all men.

805
01:07:07,965 --> 01:07:09,000
Are they?

806
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,575
What about that figure
on the right hand of our Lord...

807
01:07:11,886 --> 01:07:14,480
...seated in the place of honor?

808
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:17,183
Flowing red hair.

809
01:07:18,392 --> 01:07:20,542
Folded feminine hands.

810
01:07:21,854 --> 01:07:24,163
Hint of a bosom. No?

811
01:07:29,778 --> 01:07:33,009
It's called scotoma.
The mind sees what it chooses to see.

812
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:34,764
Who is she?

813
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:37,911
My dear, that's Mary Magdalene.

814
01:07:38,411 --> 01:07:39,400
The prostitute?

815
01:07:40,413 --> 01:07:41,812
She was no such thing.

816
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:46,681
Smeared by the Church
in 591 anno Domini, poor dear.

817
01:07:49,338 --> 01:07:52,011
Mary Magdalene was Jesus' wife.

818
01:07:59,181 --> 01:08:01,058
This is an old wives' tale.

819
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:02,703
The original one, in fact.

820
01:08:02,976 --> 01:08:04,967
There's virtually no empirical proof.

821
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:08,307
He knows as well as I do
there's much evidence to support it.

822
01:08:08,648 --> 01:08:10,240
Theories. There are theories.

823
01:08:10,525 --> 01:08:13,562
Notice how Jesus and Mary
are clothed.

824
01:08:15,113 --> 01:08:17,069
Mirror images of each other.

825
01:08:17,365 --> 01:08:19,720
The mind sees
what it chooses to see.

826
01:08:20,034 --> 01:08:24,266
And venturing into the even more
bizarre, notice how Jesus and Mary...

827
01:08:24,664 --> 01:08:28,020
...appear to be joined at the hip and
are leaning away from each other...

828
01:08:28,376 --> 01:08:32,733
...as if to create a shape in the
negative space between them.

829
01:08:33,923 --> 01:08:37,120
Leonardo gives us the chalice.

830
01:08:39,803 --> 01:08:42,237
Yes. Oh, and Robert,
notice what happens...

831
01:08:42,556 --> 01:08:45,593
...when these two figures
change position.

832
01:08:46,602 --> 01:08:49,753
Just because da Vinci painted it
doesn't make it true.

833
01:08:50,105 --> 01:08:51,902
No. But history...

834
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:54,117
...she does make it true.

835
01:08:54,401 --> 01:08:57,473
Now, listen to this. It's from
the Gospel according to Philip.

836
01:08:57,821 --> 01:08:58,776
Philip?

837
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:01,749
Yes, it was rejected
at the Council of Nicaea...

838
01:09:02,075 --> 01:09:03,986
...along with any other gospels
that made...

839
01:09:04,285 --> 01:09:06,640
...Jesus appear human
and not divine.

840
01:09:06,954 --> 01:09:11,664
"And the companion of the Savior
is Mary Magdalene.

841
01:09:12,251 --> 01:09:15,800
Christ loved her more
than all the disciples...

842
01:09:16,172 --> 01:09:17,969
...and used to kiss her on the..."

843
01:09:18,257 --> 01:09:20,009
But this says nothing of marriage.

844
01:09:20,301 --> 01:09:22,861
Well, actually...

845
01:09:23,178 --> 01:09:24,133
Robert.

846
01:09:24,847 --> 01:09:29,284
Actually, in those days, the word
"companion" literally meant "spouse."

847
01:09:29,685 --> 01:09:33,917
And this is from the Gospel
of Mary Magdalene herself.

848
01:09:34,314 --> 01:09:36,874
- She wrote a gospel?
- She may have.

849
01:09:37,192 --> 01:09:39,990
- Robert, will you fight fair?
- She may have.

850
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:44,108
"And Peter said,
'Did he prefer her to us? '

851
01:09:45,283 --> 01:09:46,477
And Levi answered:

852
01:09:46,743 --> 01:09:50,656
'Peter, I see you contending
against a woman like an adversary.

853
01:09:51,038 --> 01:09:55,316
If the Savior made her worthy,
who are you, indeed, to reject her?"'

854
01:09:55,709 --> 01:09:59,987
Yes. And then, my dear, Jesus
goes on to tell Mary Magdalene...

855
01:10:00,381 --> 01:10:04,056
...that it's up to her
to continue his Church.

856
01:10:05,344 --> 01:10:07,904
Mary Magdalene, not Peter.

857
01:10:08,847 --> 01:10:12,476
The Church was supposed
to be carried on by a woman.

858
01:10:13,101 --> 01:10:17,617
Few realize that Mary was descended
from kings, just as her husband was.

859
01:10:18,398 --> 01:10:23,392
Now, my dear, the word
in French for Holy Grail.

860
01:10:25,071 --> 01:10:28,063
From the Middle English
"Sangreal"...

861
01:10:28,407 --> 01:10:30,875
...of the original Arthurian legend.

862
01:10:31,202 --> 01:10:36,117
Now, as two words.
Can you translate for our friend?

863
01:10:38,042 --> 01:10:41,352
<i>Sang real,</i> it means "royal blood."

864
01:10:42,212 --> 01:10:46,251
When the legend speaks of the
chalice that held the blood of Christ...

865
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:52,083
...it speaks in fact of the female womb
that carried Jesus' royal bloodline.

866
01:10:53,306 --> 01:10:56,025
But how could Christ
have a bloodline, unless..?

867
01:10:56,351 --> 01:10:59,070
Mary was pregnant
at the time of the Crucifixion.

868
01:11:07,737 --> 01:11:11,889
<i>For her own safety and for that</i>
<i>of Christ's unborn child...</i>

869
01:11:12,283 --> 01:11:15,241
<i>... she fled the Holy Land</i>
<i>and came to France.</i>

870
01:11:15,578 --> 01:11:20,447
<i>And here, it is said,</i>
<i>she gave birth to a daughter, Sarah.</i>

871
01:11:21,834 --> 01:11:24,109
They know the child's name.

872
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:26,967
- A little girl.
- Yes.

873
01:11:27,256 --> 01:11:29,247
If that were true,
it's adding insult to injury.

874
01:11:29,549 --> 01:11:30,538
Why?

875
01:11:30,801 --> 01:11:34,271
The pagans found transcendence
through the joining of male to female.

876
01:11:34,638 --> 01:11:36,230
People found God through sex?

877
01:11:36,514 --> 01:11:39,267
<i>In paganism, women were worshiped</i>
<i>as a route to heaven...</i>

878
01:11:39,601 --> 01:11:42,274
...but the modern Church
has a monopoly on that...

879
01:11:42,604 --> 01:11:44,754
...in salvation through Jesus Christ.

880
01:11:45,064 --> 01:11:47,658
And he who keeps the keys to heaven
rules the world.

881
01:11:47,984 --> 01:11:51,021
Women, then, are a huge threat
to the Church.

882
01:11:51,362 --> 01:11:53,114
<i>The Catholic Inquisition</i>
<i>soon publishes...</i>

883
01:11:53,406 --> 01:11:56,557
<i>... what may be the most</i>
<i>blood-soaked book in human history.</i>

884
01:11:56,909 --> 01:11:59,184
<i>The Malleus Maleficarum.</i>

885
01:12:00,412 --> 01:12:01,970
<i>The Witches' Hammer.</i>

886
01:12:02,373 --> 01:12:05,922
It instructed the clergy on how
to locate, torture and kill...

887
01:12:06,293 --> 01:12:08,443
...all freethinking women.

888
01:12:11,715 --> 01:12:13,831
In three centuries of witch hunts...

889
01:12:14,342 --> 01:12:17,891
<i>... 50,000 women are captured,</i>
<i>burned alive at the stake.</i>

890
01:12:18,263 --> 01:12:20,777
<i>Oh, at least that. Some say millions.</i>

891
01:12:21,474 --> 01:12:23,112
Imagine, then, Robert...

892
01:12:23,685 --> 01:12:27,394
...that Christ's throne
might live on in a female child.

893
01:12:28,564 --> 01:12:31,442
You asked what would
be worth killing for.

894
01:12:32,151 --> 01:12:35,587
Witness the greatest cover-up
in human history.

895
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:38,680
This is the secret
that the Priory of Sion...

896
01:12:38,991 --> 01:12:41,266
...has defended
for over 20 centuries.

897
01:12:41,577 --> 01:12:44,614
They are the guardians
of the royal bloodline.

898
01:12:45,289 --> 01:12:48,599
The keepers of the proof
of our true past.

899
01:12:48,959 --> 01:12:53,237
They are the protectors of the living
descendants of Jesus Christ...

900
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:56,728
...and Mary Magdalene.

901
01:13:06,601 --> 01:13:07,750
<i>Sir Leigh?</i>

902
01:13:08,644 --> 01:13:11,795
Sometimes I wonder
who is serving whom.

903
01:13:12,648 --> 01:13:15,526
His sauces are not that fantastic.

904
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:19,469
<i>Yes, can I help you?</i>

905
01:13:19,738 --> 01:13:21,694
Yes. They're on the news now.

906
01:13:24,827 --> 01:13:27,978
Living descendants? Is it possible?

907
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:29,888
It's not impossible.

908
01:13:31,208 --> 01:13:34,598
You have not been honest with me.
Your pictures are on the television.

909
01:13:34,961 --> 01:13:36,758
You are wanted for four murders!

910
01:13:37,297 --> 01:13:39,447
That's why Vernet said
"killing spree."

911
01:13:39,758 --> 01:13:43,034
You come into my home,
playing on my passions for the Grail.

912
01:13:43,386 --> 01:13:45,741
- That's why he needed you.
- You will leave my house!

913
01:13:46,055 --> 01:13:47,966
- Leigh, listen!
- No, I'm calling the police.

914
01:13:48,266 --> 01:13:50,496
Jacques Saunière
was her grandfather.

915
01:13:53,479 --> 01:13:55,037
You're the obsessive Priory scholar.

916
01:13:55,314 --> 01:13:57,430
You still keep lists
of who might be in the Priory?

917
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:01,453
I'll bet Jacques Saunière
was on one of those lists.

918
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:05,919
He was on your list of who could
be Grand Master, wasn't he?

919
01:14:06,366 --> 01:14:08,800
- What?
- I'll bet he was right at the top.

920
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:14,068
Consider: Four men murdered?
The same number as the guardians.

921
01:14:14,499 --> 01:14:17,616
What if the Priory was compromised,
the other <i>sénéchaux</i> dead?

922
01:14:17,961 --> 01:14:19,952
What if you yourself were dying,
a Grand Master?

923
01:14:20,714 --> 01:14:24,024
You'd have to pass the secret on
to someone you could trust.

924
01:14:24,384 --> 01:14:25,976
Someone outside the society.

925
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:31,289
Maybe someone whose training
you had begun but never finished.

926
01:14:33,851 --> 01:14:36,240
Robert, your ruse is pathetic.

927
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,799
Not really.

928
01:14:40,441 --> 01:14:42,557
No, that's impossible.

929
01:14:45,779 --> 01:14:47,337
Can that really..?

930
01:14:49,825 --> 01:14:51,053
Is it the keystone?

931
01:14:54,496 --> 01:14:56,726
I'll even show it to you, Leigh.

932
01:14:57,207 --> 01:14:59,277
Will you just tell us
what the hell it's for?

933
01:15:17,310 --> 01:15:18,902
Fache says to wait, so I wait.

934
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:23,149
What's Fache thinking?
The truck is here. They're inside.

935
01:15:32,115 --> 01:15:33,184
Yes.

936
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:36,123
As the legend foretold:

937
01:15:38,038 --> 01:15:40,108
"It hides beneath the Rose."

938
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,973
Oh, my.

939
01:15:48,923 --> 01:15:50,322
Leigh.

940
01:15:53,803 --> 01:15:55,202
Leigh?

941
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:57,135
Please.

942
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:59,301
I'm sorry. Yes, of course.

943
01:16:01,811 --> 01:16:03,722
Inside the keystone...

944
01:16:05,189 --> 01:16:06,622
...there'll be a map.

945
01:16:06,899 --> 01:16:09,572
A map that will lead us
to the Holy Grail.

946
01:16:13,655 --> 01:16:16,453
To be trained by
the Grand Master himself.

947
01:16:17,033 --> 01:16:20,708
Did he pass down the fleur-de-lis?
Is that how you found this?

948
01:16:23,415 --> 01:16:26,168
And he must have sung you
the riddle songs.

949
01:16:26,501 --> 01:16:27,934
I know some of them.

950
01:16:37,303 --> 01:16:39,055
Can you keep secrets?

951
01:16:40,723 --> 01:16:43,476
Can you know a thing
and never say it again?

952
01:16:44,685 --> 01:16:45,674
And codes?

953
01:16:47,021 --> 01:16:50,855
I imagine they lie down
for you like lovers.

954
01:16:54,027 --> 01:16:58,703
A <i>sénéchal.</i> A guardian of the Grail
right here in my own home.

955
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:01,868
Tell him, please.
I don't know any of this.

956
01:17:02,202 --> 01:17:04,921
Leigh, it's not that simple.
She doesn't rem...

957
01:17:06,623 --> 01:17:07,817
Robert!

958
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:14,486
Do not move, woman.

959
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:19,798
Cripple.

960
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:24,132
Put the box on the table.

961
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:26,604
What, this trifle?

962
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:30,680
Well, perhaps we can make
a financial arrangement.

963
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:33,941
Put the keystone on the table.

964
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:36,625
You will not succeed.

965
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:42,024
Only the worthy
can unlock the stone.

966
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,835
Rip the gate down.

967
01:18:17,441 --> 01:18:19,033
Well, well, my dear.

968
01:18:23,321 --> 01:18:24,549
Sit down.

969
01:18:24,823 --> 01:18:26,176
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

970
01:18:26,449 --> 01:18:28,485
- Are you?
- Yeah.

971
01:18:28,785 --> 01:18:31,015
Yes, well, make yourself useful,
you French fool.

972
01:18:31,329 --> 01:18:33,365
Get something
to restrain this monster.

973
01:18:38,502 --> 01:18:40,015
Above the joint.

974
01:18:40,963 --> 01:18:45,320
Fortunately,
a dragon most easy to slay.

975
01:18:45,718 --> 01:18:47,037
He's wearing a cilice.

976
01:18:47,928 --> 01:18:49,998
- A what?
- Well, look.

977
01:18:52,641 --> 01:18:54,996
Inflicts pain so he can suffer
as Christ suffered.

978
01:18:55,435 --> 01:18:56,663
Opus Dei.

979
01:18:57,104 --> 01:18:58,537
Fache is Opus Dei.

980
01:18:59,856 --> 01:19:02,689
The policeman who's chasing us.
He wears the cross in the world.

981
01:19:03,026 --> 01:19:04,584
Robert.

982
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:10,147
Well, I must say,
you two are anything but dull.

983
01:19:11,576 --> 01:19:12,531
Leigh?

984
01:19:14,746 --> 01:19:16,577
You want what's in this box?

985
01:19:17,832 --> 01:19:19,470
We need a way out of here.

986
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,661
Well, actually...

987
01:19:22,878 --> 01:19:24,470
...I do have a plane.

988
01:19:35,098 --> 01:19:36,850
<i>- Robert! Where do we go?</i>
<i>- Come along.</i>

989
01:19:37,142 --> 01:19:38,894
<i>- In here. Come in.</i>
<i>- Over here.</i>

990
01:19:39,186 --> 01:19:41,541
<i>Get the door. Hurry.</i>

991
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:45,771
<i>Over here. Over here. Sophie.</i>

992
01:19:46,067 --> 01:19:47,261
<i>Watch out!</i>

993
01:19:48,486 --> 01:19:49,965
<i>Be careful.</i>

994
01:19:50,238 --> 01:19:51,307
<i>Come, Rem...</i>

995
01:19:59,247 --> 01:20:00,521
Shit.

996
01:20:03,626 --> 01:20:04,615
Easy.

997
01:20:27,607 --> 01:20:28,562
Jesus!

998
01:20:28,817 --> 01:20:29,772
Apropos.

999
01:20:32,695 --> 01:20:34,492
I can't imagine
what your complaint is.

1000
01:20:34,781 --> 01:20:37,614
I'd be within my rights to shoot you
and let you rot in my woods!

1001
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:40,225
Put that away. We might need him.

1002
01:20:40,953 --> 01:20:42,022
Better.

1003
01:20:49,086 --> 01:20:50,644
Opus Dei.

1004
01:20:51,672 --> 01:20:54,061
- What is it?
- A conservative Catholic sect.

1005
01:20:54,383 --> 01:20:56,180
Opus Dei is a prelature
to the Vatican.

1006
01:20:56,468 --> 01:20:59,619
You're saying the Vatican
is killing people for this box?

1007
01:20:59,971 --> 01:21:01,848
No, no, no. Not the Vatican...

1008
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:04,495
...and not Opus Dei,
but we are in the middle of a war.

1009
01:21:04,809 --> 01:21:07,164
And one that has been
going on forever.

1010
01:21:07,479 --> 01:21:09,595
On the one side stands the Priory...

1011
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:12,412
...and on the other
an ancient group of despots...

1012
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:14,884
...with members hidden
in high-ranking positions...

1013
01:21:15,194 --> 01:21:16,866
...throughout the Church.

1014
01:21:17,155 --> 01:21:21,626
And this Council of Shadows tries
to destroy proof of the bloodline.

1015
01:21:22,034 --> 01:21:24,548
And that throughout history,
they seek out and kill...

1016
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:26,701
...the living descendants
of Jesus Christ.

1017
01:21:26,997 --> 01:21:28,589
- That's insane.
- Is it?

1018
01:21:30,334 --> 01:21:31,562
What if the world discovers...

1019
01:21:31,835 --> 01:21:34,474
...that the greatest story ever told
is actually a lie?

1020
01:21:34,797 --> 01:21:38,312
The Vatican faces a crisis of faith
unprecedented.

1021
01:21:39,176 --> 01:21:41,690
I've got a signal now, sir. It's ringing.

1022
01:21:44,014 --> 01:21:48,530
Roger, look, I'm so sorry. I've got
tired of the weather here in France...

1023
01:21:49,144 --> 01:21:51,942
...and could you make
the plane ready for...

1024
01:21:54,023 --> 01:21:55,092
...Zurich.

1025
01:21:55,733 --> 01:21:57,132
Yes. No, we love Zurich.

1026
01:22:05,201 --> 01:22:07,590
What the hell do you mean,
you lost them? Collet.

1027
01:22:09,872 --> 01:22:11,225
You're the one who lost them.

1028
01:22:11,707 --> 01:22:13,106
You control every step
of this investigation.

1029
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:15,684
You don't let anybody breathe.

1030
01:22:16,336 --> 01:22:18,896
You're acting like
you lost your mind.

1031
01:22:22,384 --> 01:22:25,103
What is it with these two birds?

1032
01:22:29,349 --> 01:22:32,068
Interpol just registered a new
flight plan from Le Bourget.

1033
01:22:33,061 --> 01:22:36,178
Stay out of my way on this, Collet.

1034
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,637
Did you kill Jacques Saunière?

1035
01:23:09,095 --> 01:23:11,051
Did you kill Jacques Saunière?

1036
01:23:12,098 --> 01:23:13,816
I am the messenger of God.

1037
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:19,840
Did you kill my grandfather?

1038
01:23:23,109 --> 01:23:24,667
I am the messenger...

1039
01:23:25,236 --> 01:23:29,115
Each breath you take is a sin.

1040
01:23:30,783 --> 01:23:33,058
No shadow will be safe again.

1041
01:23:33,369 --> 01:23:37,885
For you will be hunted by angels.

1042
01:23:39,541 --> 01:23:41,418
You believe in God?

1043
01:23:42,794 --> 01:23:45,149
Your God doesn't forgive murderers.

1044
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,552
He burns them.

1045
01:24:01,854 --> 01:24:02,809
Sophie.

1046
01:24:29,381 --> 01:24:30,894
The Teacher will be pleased.

1047
01:24:31,174 --> 01:24:33,244
What will you do
once you have the Grail?

1048
01:24:33,551 --> 01:24:34,745
Destroy it.

1049
01:24:35,011 --> 01:24:38,481
The documents and the
sarcophagus, of course.

1050
01:24:40,016 --> 01:24:41,335
And the heir?

1051
01:24:45,187 --> 01:24:48,497
Will you exercise the final edict?
Spill his blood?

1052
01:24:49,275 --> 01:24:50,674
There will be no need.

1053
01:24:50,943 --> 01:24:55,459
Once the sarcophagus is destroyed,
DNA testing will be impossible.

1054
01:24:55,864 --> 01:24:58,458
There is no way to prove
a living bloodline.

1055
01:24:59,284 --> 01:25:00,842
But if you had to...

1056
01:25:02,537 --> 01:25:05,449
...would you do as councils
have done before us?

1057
01:25:14,549 --> 01:25:15,777
Christ...

1058
01:25:20,805 --> 01:25:24,878
Christ sacrificed his life
for the betterment of humanity.

1059
01:25:28,521 --> 01:25:31,274
So, too, may be the fate of his seed.

1060
01:25:38,739 --> 01:25:40,457
I need the flight plan.

1061
01:25:40,866 --> 01:25:41,821
Ten minutes.

1062
01:25:42,868 --> 01:25:45,098
I asked you to get it for me.

1063
01:25:46,371 --> 01:25:48,168
I'm on break.

1064
01:25:49,749 --> 01:25:51,228
Come back in 10 minutes.

1065
01:25:53,336 --> 01:25:55,372
My nose! My nose!

1066
01:25:56,089 --> 01:25:57,363
The flight plan, please.

1067
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,587
You asshole!

1068
01:26:11,854 --> 01:26:13,572
It's not "cross."

1069
01:26:14,898 --> 01:26:16,126
"Spear"?

1070
01:26:20,779 --> 01:26:22,212
What happened to her?

1071
01:26:23,073 --> 01:26:24,586
No one knows.

1072
01:26:25,117 --> 01:26:28,268
<i>Mary Magdalene lived out</i>
<i>her days in hiding.</i>

1073
01:26:30,121 --> 01:26:32,396
And the zealots pursued her still...

1074
01:26:33,124 --> 01:26:37,276
...even in death, trying to destroy
proof of her existence.

1075
01:26:38,463 --> 01:26:40,693
But she always had her Knights.

1076
01:26:41,007 --> 01:26:43,316
<i>Brave men sworn to defend her.</i>

1077
01:26:43,634 --> 01:26:46,102
<i>You see, to worship</i>
<i>before her sarcophagus...</i>

1078
01:26:46,721 --> 01:26:49,838
<i>... to kneel before the bones</i>
<i>of Mary Magdalene...</i>

1079
01:26:50,182 --> 01:26:53,219
...was to remember all those
who were robbed of their power...

1080
01:26:53,561 --> 01:26:54,516
...who were oppressed.

1081
01:26:54,979 --> 01:26:59,211
Ultimately, the Priory hid her remains
and the proof of her bloodline...

1082
01:26:59,608 --> 01:27:02,122
...until most believed
her sarcophagus...

1083
01:27:03,236 --> 01:27:04,828
<i>... the Holy Grail...</i>

1084
01:27:05,906 --> 01:27:08,739
...was finally lost in time.

1085
01:27:19,794 --> 01:27:20,749
What are you doing?

1086
01:27:21,003 --> 01:27:23,517
At the chateau, you said,
"It hides beneath the Rose."

1087
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,159
No, no, no. Do be careful.

1088
01:27:25,424 --> 01:27:28,860
In Latin, <i>sub rosa.</i>
Literal translation...

1089
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:30,733
"Beneath the rose."

1090
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:45,258
We need a mirror.

1091
01:27:45,527 --> 01:27:48,200
Backwards. In the style
of Leonardo himself.

1092
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:50,122
Thank you.

1093
01:27:54,536 --> 01:27:58,324
<i>In London lies a knight</i>
<i>a Pope interred</i>

1094
01:27:58,706 --> 01:28:02,255
<i>His labor's fruit</i>
<i>a Holy wrath incurred</i>

1095
01:28:02,835 --> 01:28:05,633
<i>You seek the orb</i>
<i>that ought be on his tomb</i>

1096
01:28:06,172 --> 01:28:09,687
<i>It speaks of Rosy flesh</i>
<i>and seeded womb</i>

1097
01:28:10,051 --> 01:28:13,760
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred"?

1098
01:28:14,138 --> 01:28:17,767
A knight whose funeral
was presided over by the Pope.

1099
01:28:18,142 --> 01:28:21,214
Of course, the Priory knights
were not just any knights.

1100
01:28:21,562 --> 01:28:22,517
Templars.

1101
01:28:22,771 --> 01:28:25,683
And there's just one place to bury
a Templar knight in London.

1102
01:28:26,024 --> 01:28:27,059
Temple Church.

1103
01:28:27,317 --> 01:28:29,387
Temple Church.
If you'll excuse me, my dear...

1104
01:28:29,694 --> 01:28:32,413
...Roger and I must discuss
a change in flight plan.

1105
01:28:32,739 --> 01:28:34,013
Leigh.

1106
01:28:35,825 --> 01:28:38,100
Harboring and transporting fugitives?

1107
01:28:38,995 --> 01:28:41,429
You are already implicated enough.

1108
01:28:42,749 --> 01:28:46,219
You and I, Robert,
have observed history.

1109
01:28:46,586 --> 01:28:48,702
Time has been our glass.

1110
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:52,417
We are in history now. Living it.

1111
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:55,818
Making it.

1112
01:28:56,595 --> 01:28:57,994
"Implicated"?

1113
01:28:58,263 --> 01:29:00,697
I am on a Grail quest.

1114
01:29:02,434 --> 01:29:03,913
Forgive me, Robert...

1115
01:29:04,186 --> 01:29:06,336
...but you two may well
have given this old man...

1116
01:29:06,646 --> 01:29:08,876
...the greatest night of his life.

1117
01:29:10,859 --> 01:29:11,928
Thank you.

1118
01:29:14,112 --> 01:29:16,228
He's going to want more money.

1119
01:29:33,464 --> 01:29:37,423
I suppose this is a new technique
for investigations.

1120
01:29:37,801 --> 01:29:42,670
I've lost them.
They flew to Switzerland.

1121
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:45,256
No extradition.

1122
01:29:48,145 --> 01:29:54,141
The controller filed charges.
Ari was on dispatch. He called me.

1123
01:29:58,488 --> 01:30:01,446
What's going on, Bezu?

1124
01:30:04,619 --> 01:30:07,338
You know that I am Opus Dei?

1125
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:09,309
Yes.

1126
01:30:14,670 --> 01:30:18,026
A bishop of my order called me.

1127
01:30:18,507 --> 01:30:20,543
He said a killer
came to him in confession.

1128
01:30:20,843 --> 01:30:23,437
His name was Robert Langdon.

1129
01:30:24,763 --> 01:30:27,721
He said I couldn't imagine
the evil in this man's heart.

1130
01:30:28,058 --> 01:30:30,652
That he would keep killing.

1131
01:30:31,186 --> 01:30:33,495
He said I had to stop him.

1132
01:30:35,690 --> 01:30:39,319
The bishop broke his vows
to tell me this.

1133
01:30:39,694 --> 01:30:42,925
He charged me
to stop Robert Langdon.

1134
01:30:46,033 --> 01:30:50,584
Tell me, Collet, who have I failed?

1135
01:30:51,622 --> 01:30:53,294
The bishop?

1136
01:30:54,708 --> 01:30:56,699
God himself?

1137
01:31:05,427 --> 01:31:08,385
They've changed their flight plan
to London.

1138
01:31:37,041 --> 01:31:40,590
I have them, tower. Relay Hawker
to land and hold on tarmac.

1139
01:32:38,058 --> 01:32:40,174
- Secure the area!
- Wider!

1140
01:32:40,477 --> 01:32:42,468
- Armed police!
- You two, round the back!

1141
01:32:42,937 --> 01:32:45,974
Armed police!
Put your hands in the air!

1142
01:32:46,315 --> 01:32:48,192
- Three men up!
- Ready!

1143
01:32:48,484 --> 01:32:50,952
Put your hands in the air! Do it now!

1144
01:32:51,279 --> 01:32:53,554
I'm afraid that's
easier said than done in my case.

1145
01:32:55,741 --> 01:32:56,969
Oh, good morning.

1146
01:32:57,243 --> 01:32:59,996
Did that old cannabis charge
finally catch up with me?

1147
01:33:00,329 --> 01:33:02,889
Sir, the French police say
you're transporting fugitives...

1148
01:33:03,207 --> 01:33:04,879
...and you may have
a hostage onboard.

1149
01:33:05,167 --> 01:33:06,646
I'm to take you all into custody.

1150
01:33:06,919 --> 01:33:10,116
Sadly, I have an important medical
appointment which I can't miss.

1151
01:33:10,464 --> 01:33:11,613
I'll fetch the car, sir.

1152
01:33:11,882 --> 01:33:14,601
This is serious, sir. The French police
are on their way. Stop!

1153
01:33:15,343 --> 01:33:18,460
Inspector, I can't afford the time
to indulge your games.

1154
01:33:18,805 --> 01:33:20,079
I'm late and I'm leaving.

1155
01:33:20,348 --> 01:33:22,066
If it's so important
for you to stop us...

1156
01:33:22,350 --> 01:33:24,500
...then you're just going
to have to shoot us.

1157
01:33:25,144 --> 01:33:26,702
You can start with him.

1158
01:33:32,193 --> 01:33:33,672
Search the plane.

1159
01:33:33,944 --> 01:33:35,093
All right.

1160
01:33:47,374 --> 01:33:48,966
I could run them over.

1161
01:33:54,548 --> 01:33:55,617
Bad tip.

1162
01:33:57,717 --> 01:33:58,991
Let him go.

1163
01:34:03,556 --> 01:34:05,831
The French cannot be trusted.

1164
01:34:14,608 --> 01:34:15,563
Everyone comfy?

1165
01:34:18,028 --> 01:34:18,983
Biscuits?

1166
01:34:19,613 --> 01:34:21,205
They didn't notice anything?

1167
01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:25,977
Well, people rarely notice things right
in front of their eyes, don't you find?

1168
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:42,775
<i>Do you have the bonds, bishop?</i>

1169
01:34:43,094 --> 01:34:44,288
Yes, I do, Teacher.

1170
01:34:44,554 --> 01:34:47,705
<i>I have chosen an Opus Dei</i>
<i>residence for the exchange.</i>

1171
01:34:48,057 --> 01:34:49,410
I am honored.

1172
01:34:49,767 --> 01:34:54,318
<i>By the time you get to London,</i>
<i>I will have the Grail.</i>

1173
01:35:00,027 --> 01:35:04,817
Remember, if we are discovered by
the Vatican, we are excommunicated.

1174
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:08,118
- So should anything go wrong...
- Yes, I know, I know.

1175
01:35:09,369 --> 01:35:11,007
This council does not exist.

1176
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:13,677
As it never has.

1177
01:35:16,626 --> 01:35:20,221
Old friend. Heaven protect you.

1178
01:35:27,887 --> 01:35:29,764
Keep an eye out for the police.

1179
01:35:42,985 --> 01:35:45,499
I must say, Robert,
I'm quite impressed...

1180
01:35:45,821 --> 01:35:48,972
...by the way you withstood
my little airplane.

1181
01:35:50,742 --> 01:35:52,221
Did he never tell you?

1182
01:35:52,494 --> 01:35:55,645
When he was a boy,
young Robert fell into a well.

1183
01:35:55,997 --> 01:35:57,555
How old were you?

1184
01:35:57,832 --> 01:35:58,901
Seven.

1185
01:36:01,669 --> 01:36:04,581
Treading water all night long,
screaming his lungs out...

1186
01:36:04,923 --> 01:36:06,834
...to the echoes screaming back.

1187
01:36:07,133 --> 01:36:09,522
When they found him,
he was nearly catatonic.

1188
01:36:09,844 --> 01:36:10,879
Help!

1189
01:36:12,013 --> 01:36:13,241
It was a long time ago.

1190
01:36:13,514 --> 01:36:15,072
Oh, now, now, Robert.

1191
01:36:15,349 --> 01:36:19,627
You above all people shouldn't be one
to dismiss the influence of the past.

1192
01:36:25,317 --> 01:36:29,356
Tell me, why has the Priory kept the
Grail location secret all these years?

1193
01:36:29,738 --> 01:36:30,693
I don't know.

1194
01:36:31,156 --> 01:36:33,670
Some say the Priory wait
for the heir to reveal himself...

1195
01:36:33,992 --> 01:36:35,664
...which is especially odd...

1196
01:36:35,952 --> 01:36:39,149
...since legend suggests he may not
know his own true identity.

1197
01:36:47,255 --> 01:36:48,210
Hello?

1198
01:36:49,048 --> 01:36:51,562
Why do they make them so scary?

1199
01:36:57,348 --> 01:36:58,383
Oh, it's cold.

1200
01:36:58,641 --> 01:37:01,792
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1201
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:15,051
So which tomb has an orb?

1202
01:37:17,158 --> 01:37:20,230
Two wear tunics over their armor...

1203
01:37:20,578 --> 01:37:23,570
...and two have full-length robes.

1204
01:37:24,791 --> 01:37:26,463
Two are grasping swords.

1205
01:37:27,001 --> 01:37:30,437
And one... Two are praying.

1206
01:37:32,590 --> 01:37:34,467
This one has his arms at his sides.

1207
01:37:34,759 --> 01:37:38,229
Oh, and this poor fellow
has almost disappeared entirely.

1208
01:37:38,596 --> 01:37:43,112
I don't see any orb
that ought be on a tomb.

1209
01:37:44,226 --> 01:37:46,820
"Ought be on his tomb."
Are we looking for a missing orb?

1210
01:37:47,146 --> 01:37:49,455
Maybe. Over here, see.

1211
01:37:54,111 --> 01:37:55,590
These aren't tombs.

1212
01:37:55,862 --> 01:37:58,137
- What? Yes, of course they are.
- No.

1213
01:37:58,448 --> 01:38:00,325
- They're effigies.
- What?

1214
01:38:00,617 --> 01:38:02,448
Not tombs. There's no bodies here.

1215
01:38:02,744 --> 01:38:04,097
This place is wrong.

1216
01:38:06,206 --> 01:38:09,403
Can we go now? We should go.

1217
01:38:12,753 --> 01:38:14,345
Sophie! No!

1218
01:38:16,173 --> 01:38:17,526
Where is the keystone?

1219
01:38:18,759 --> 01:38:19,828
Do not test me!

1220
01:38:20,094 --> 01:38:21,288
- Let her go!
- Don't hurt her.

1221
01:38:21,554 --> 01:38:23,510
Give me the keystone! Give it to me!

1222
01:38:23,806 --> 01:38:25,444
Here! Here! Here it is! Here it is.

1223
01:38:25,724 --> 01:38:29,194
Just let her go, and you and I can...
We'll come to some agreement.

1224
01:38:29,978 --> 01:38:31,331
Remy.

1225
01:38:34,775 --> 01:38:37,164
Remy. No, no, no. No, put it away.

1226
01:38:38,612 --> 01:38:41,684
Put it away. They're too close together.
You don't have a clear shot.

1227
01:38:42,032 --> 01:38:44,307
- Yes, I do.
- What do you think you're doing?

1228
01:38:46,661 --> 01:38:50,893
Thank you, professor. For a moment,
this was getting complicated.

1229
01:38:51,290 --> 01:38:53,246
Oh, this is absurd.
Oh, for God's sake, man!

1230
01:38:56,671 --> 01:38:58,707
That was satisfying.

1231
01:38:59,006 --> 01:39:00,758
I'm glad this bullshit is over.

1232
01:39:04,094 --> 01:39:05,732
Throw Teabing in the trunk.

1233
01:39:06,013 --> 01:39:07,207
What?

1234
01:39:12,686 --> 01:39:14,563
Here. You okay?

1235
01:39:20,193 --> 01:39:21,148
Sorry.

1236
01:40:02,150 --> 01:40:03,868
I don't think he's following.

1237
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:15,869
They won't kill Leigh
until they find the Grail.

1238
01:40:18,165 --> 01:40:21,237
- So we have to find it before they do.
- I have to get to a library, fast.

1239
01:40:29,468 --> 01:40:34,178
He once whined to me about the
wasted space of so large a trunk.

1240
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:36,926
Let's see if he complains so now.

1241
01:40:38,101 --> 01:40:39,932
Are you the Teacher?

1242
01:40:43,273 --> 01:40:44,228
I am.

1243
01:40:46,109 --> 01:40:50,387
Superbly done.
You've been of great service.

1244
01:40:54,117 --> 01:40:56,756
The cryptex has yet to be opened.
I can still serve.

1245
01:40:57,078 --> 01:40:59,114
You've done enough.

1246
01:41:02,458 --> 01:41:05,928
We cannot let ego
deter us from our goal.

1247
01:41:07,296 --> 01:41:09,127
I understand.

1248
01:41:10,299 --> 01:41:11,368
Good.

1249
01:41:14,636 --> 01:41:19,187
Wait here, at this house of Opus Dei,
and you will be rewarded.

1250
01:41:19,599 --> 01:41:21,669
I will dispose of the old man.

1251
01:41:22,978 --> 01:41:24,536
Bless you, Silas.

1252
01:41:26,648 --> 01:41:27,797
Teacher.

1253
01:41:36,073 --> 01:41:37,711
Christ be with you.

1254
01:41:40,536 --> 01:41:45,451
We're at least a half-hour
to Chelsea Library.

1255
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,911
If we're gonna help Leigh,
that's too long.

1256
01:41:59,721 --> 01:42:01,074
Where you going?

1257
01:42:01,348 --> 01:42:03,384
Getting you a library card.

1258
01:42:07,061 --> 01:42:09,017
Excuse me. May I sit next to you?

1259
01:42:09,314 --> 01:42:11,703
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

1260
01:42:20,366 --> 01:42:21,594
That's great.

1261
01:42:22,576 --> 01:42:24,692
Didn't say you had a boyfriend.

1262
01:42:27,498 --> 01:42:28,726
Thanks.

1263
01:42:29,416 --> 01:42:32,567
Let's see if we can access
the database on this.

1264
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:36,196
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1265
01:42:36,548 --> 01:42:38,220
Compounding keywords:

1266
01:42:38,508 --> 01:42:41,227
Knight, Pope, Grail.

1267
01:42:42,012 --> 01:42:45,846
Your precious treasure was
almost lost, and with it, my fortune.

1268
01:42:50,395 --> 01:42:52,590
Can you believe how well I did?

1269
01:42:54,232 --> 01:42:56,268
I even convinced the monk.

1270
01:42:57,235 --> 01:42:59,112
I should be in theatre.

1271
01:43:05,910 --> 01:43:11,143
A toast to our success, Teacher.
The end of the journey is near.

1272
01:43:13,917 --> 01:43:17,068
Your identity shall go
with me to the grave.

1273
01:43:22,717 --> 01:43:26,073
There's your problem, mate.
It's your basic linguistic coincidence.

1274
01:43:26,763 --> 01:43:28,799
See, keywords keep coming up
with the writings...

1275
01:43:29,098 --> 01:43:31,896
...of some bloke named
Alexander Pope.

1276
01:43:32,226 --> 01:43:33,375
"A. Pope."

1277
01:43:35,104 --> 01:43:36,742
Your grandfather was a genius.

1278
01:43:41,777 --> 01:43:42,732
Come on.

1279
01:44:17,478 --> 01:44:19,070
<i>Emergency.</i>
<i>Which service do you require?</i>

1280
01:44:19,355 --> 01:44:24,224
I know the location of two murderers
wanted by French police.

1281
01:44:28,364 --> 01:44:30,355
We've just had a 999 call.

1282
01:44:30,658 --> 01:44:32,888
Triangulation leads back
to Docklands.

1283
01:44:33,202 --> 01:44:35,193
Caller was male.
Claimed your two murderers...

1284
01:44:35,495 --> 01:44:37,963
...are hiding at an Opus Dei house.

1285
01:44:47,215 --> 01:44:51,128
The knight we're looking for
is Sir Isaac Newton.

1286
01:44:52,845 --> 01:44:56,394
His life's work produced new sciences
that incurred the wrath of the Church.

1287
01:44:57,058 --> 01:44:59,208
Gravity, for God sakes.

1288
01:45:00,686 --> 01:45:03,644
And if you choose to believe...

1289
01:45:03,981 --> 01:45:08,179
...he was also a Grand Master
of the Priory as well.

1290
01:45:18,954 --> 01:45:21,422
But if he offended
the Catholic Church...

1291
01:45:21,748 --> 01:45:25,343
...the Pope would be the last person
to preside over his funeral.

1292
01:45:25,710 --> 01:45:27,826
Well, that's where I got it wrong.

1293
01:45:28,129 --> 01:45:30,882
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1294
01:45:31,216 --> 01:45:34,174
Sir Isaac Newton's funeral
was presided over...

1295
01:45:34,510 --> 01:45:37,980
...by his good friend,
his colleague, Alexander Pope.

1296
01:45:38,347 --> 01:45:42,579
A. Pope. His first initial.
How did I miss that?

1297
01:45:43,227 --> 01:45:44,262
Here.

1298
01:45:44,687 --> 01:45:47,679
Yes. Isaac Newton's tomb.

1299
01:45:48,941 --> 01:45:50,090
An orb.

1300
01:45:50,359 --> 01:45:55,069
Yes. Which one? It's not possible
to tell if a particular orb is missing.

1301
01:45:55,489 --> 01:45:58,879
"An orb with Rosy flesh
and seeded womb."

1302
01:45:59,242 --> 01:46:03,599
Solar system. The planets.
Constellations. Signs of the zodiac.

1303
01:46:04,414 --> 01:46:06,405
See, our moon is missing.

1304
01:46:06,708 --> 01:46:09,427
The moons of Saturn and Jupiter.
They're not here.

1305
01:46:09,919 --> 01:46:12,308
Eyes of the cherubs themselves?

1306
01:46:14,424 --> 01:46:17,222
Robert. These tracks.

1307
01:46:18,219 --> 01:46:20,414
Look at the cane marks in the dust.

1308
01:46:23,599 --> 01:46:24,952
Teabing was here.

1309
01:46:26,435 --> 01:46:27,504
He was alone.

1310
01:46:29,605 --> 01:46:33,518
When the two of you
arrived at my home as you did...

1311
01:46:34,818 --> 01:46:37,491
...others might call it God's will.

1312
01:46:38,530 --> 01:46:40,839
I believed that if I had the cryptex...

1313
01:46:41,408 --> 01:46:44,286
...I could solve the riddle alone.

1314
01:46:45,328 --> 01:46:46,727
But I was unworthy.

1315
01:46:46,997 --> 01:46:48,191
But you...

1316
01:46:49,124 --> 01:46:51,433
You have a reason to be here.

1317
01:46:51,751 --> 01:46:55,221
You're the last remaining
guardian of the Grail.

1318
01:46:55,630 --> 01:46:57,621
Your grandfather
and the other <i>sénéchaux...</i>

1319
01:46:57,924 --> 01:46:59,801
...would not have lied
with dying breath...

1320
01:47:00,092 --> 01:47:02,731
...unless they knew
their secret was preserved.

1321
01:47:05,348 --> 01:47:07,908
How could you know
Saunière's last words?

1322
01:47:08,225 --> 01:47:09,180
Leigh.

1323
01:47:10,477 --> 01:47:12,547
Grail quests require sacrifice.

1324
01:47:13,272 --> 01:47:14,546
You are a murderer.

1325
01:47:14,815 --> 01:47:17,693
No. No. Robert, tell her.

1326
01:47:18,026 --> 01:47:21,655
When history is written,
murderers are heroes.

1327
01:47:23,949 --> 01:47:25,860
You self-righteous bastard!

1328
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:27,387
We need to just walk away.

1329
01:47:27,661 --> 01:47:29,379
- No, don't. Don't.
- Walk away.

1330
01:47:32,791 --> 01:47:34,224
I'll do what I have to now.

1331
01:47:39,672 --> 01:47:40,741
Anything.

1332
01:47:44,969 --> 01:47:46,322
Do you understand?

1333
01:47:48,097 --> 01:47:49,610
So now...

1334
01:47:50,975 --> 01:47:52,886
...can't we all be friends again?

1335
01:47:54,311 --> 01:47:55,539
This way.

1336
01:48:31,889 --> 01:48:35,438
I'm going to put this gun down.
I only want you both to listen.

1337
01:48:37,561 --> 01:48:38,630
I'm listening now.

1338
01:48:39,354 --> 01:48:40,628
For 2000 years...

1339
01:48:41,398 --> 01:48:45,027
<i>... the Church has rained oppression</i>
<i>and atrocity upon mankind...</i>

1340
01:48:46,069 --> 01:48:50,745
<i>... crushed passion and idea alike,</i>
<i>all in the name of their walking God.</i>

1341
01:48:51,282 --> 01:48:55,434
Proof of Jesus' mortality can bring
an end to all that suffering...

1342
01:48:56,204 --> 01:48:58,957
...drive this church of lies
to its knees.

1343
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:02,263
Armed police!

1344
01:49:02,585 --> 01:49:03,813
Drop your weapon!

1345
01:49:07,548 --> 01:49:08,981
Stop, Silas!

1346
01:49:21,311 --> 01:49:24,303
We are betrayed, my son.

1347
01:49:25,065 --> 01:49:27,533
The living heir must be revealed.

1348
01:49:28,151 --> 01:49:30,301
Jesus must be shown
for what he was.

1349
01:49:30,612 --> 01:49:33,649
Not miraculous, simply man.

1350
01:49:34,908 --> 01:49:36,307
I'm sorry.

1351
01:49:38,536 --> 01:49:40,049
Armed police!

1352
01:49:40,496 --> 01:49:43,454
Drop your weapon! Drop it! Drop it!

1353
01:49:53,050 --> 01:49:55,359
Put it down now! Put it down!

1354
01:50:03,268 --> 01:50:05,179
I am a ghost.

1355
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:08,948
The dark con can be exposed.

1356
01:50:09,316 --> 01:50:14,390
Mankind can finally be set free,
and we can do it, Robert.

1357
01:50:15,864 --> 01:50:17,343
The three of us.

1358
01:50:35,341 --> 01:50:36,660
How is Silas?

1359
01:50:36,925 --> 01:50:39,155
Is he..? Is he alive?

1360
01:50:39,636 --> 01:50:40,671
The monk?

1361
01:50:44,307 --> 01:50:47,105
Bishop, how would you know
this killer's name?

1362
01:50:48,812 --> 01:50:50,404
Get me out of here, Fache.

1363
01:50:51,064 --> 01:50:52,019
Wait.

1364
01:50:55,568 --> 01:50:58,366
Langdon never came to you
in confession, did he?

1365
01:50:59,322 --> 01:51:03,315
One of your followers called you
about the crime-scene photos.

1366
01:51:04,410 --> 01:51:09,165
I cannot be implicated here. There are
still important works to be done.

1367
01:51:11,167 --> 01:51:12,395
You used me.

1368
01:51:14,378 --> 01:51:16,289
God uses us all.

1369
01:51:17,214 --> 01:51:18,647
Help me, Fache.

1370
01:51:19,883 --> 01:51:20,918
Take him.

1371
01:51:25,681 --> 01:51:27,433
- Did you get his cell phone?
- Yes, sir.

1372
01:51:27,724 --> 01:51:29,635
I'm going to need a trace.

1373
01:51:32,604 --> 01:51:34,322
Your Silas is dead.

1374
01:51:41,571 --> 01:51:43,209
The Priory's sacred charge...

1375
01:51:43,489 --> 01:51:46,322
...was to reveal the heir
at the dawn of the new millennium.

1376
01:51:47,535 --> 01:51:52,450
The millennium came and went
and the living heir remained hidden.

1377
01:51:52,873 --> 01:51:56,582
The Priory failed
in their sacred charge.

1378
01:51:57,586 --> 01:51:59,497
So, what choice did I have?

1379
01:52:03,884 --> 01:52:05,602
I sought out the enemy.

1380
01:52:07,137 --> 01:52:11,369
I persuaded them, the Council
of Shadows, that I was an ally.

1381
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:15,649
I even asked them for money
so they would never suspect me.

1382
01:52:16,312 --> 01:52:19,145
<i>Rector,</i> I made them call me.

1383
01:52:19,774 --> 01:52:20,729
"Teacher."

1384
01:52:21,025 --> 01:52:22,219
- Why don't you and I...
- No.

1385
01:52:22,485 --> 01:52:24,953
Robert, no words. On your knees.

1386
01:52:25,571 --> 01:52:26,686
Do it.

1387
01:52:27,281 --> 01:52:28,600
No, I mean it. Down.

1388
01:52:29,742 --> 01:52:32,415
Not you. No, my dear, you...

1389
01:52:35,206 --> 01:52:37,481
You're my miracle, Sophie.

1390
01:52:38,250 --> 01:52:40,559
You're the guardian of the Grail.

1391
01:52:41,628 --> 01:52:44,984
All the oppression of the poor
and the powerless...

1392
01:52:45,340 --> 01:52:48,093
...of those of different skin,
of women.

1393
01:52:48,427 --> 01:52:51,499
You can put an end to all that.

1394
01:52:51,846 --> 01:52:55,395
You must explode the truth
onto the world.

1395
01:52:56,351 --> 01:52:57,750
It's your duty.

1396
01:53:00,772 --> 01:53:03,366
You know the answer to this riddle.

1397
01:53:04,984 --> 01:53:06,383
Open the cryptex...

1398
01:53:08,112 --> 01:53:09,670
...and I'll put down the gun.

1399
01:53:27,964 --> 01:53:29,841
I have no idea how.

1400
01:53:30,133 --> 01:53:31,885
I don't know the code.

1401
01:53:32,177 --> 01:53:34,737
And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

1402
01:53:40,518 --> 01:53:42,713
Like your grandfather, then.

1403
01:53:43,521 --> 01:53:46,354
Willing to die for your secret.

1404
01:53:47,692 --> 01:53:51,002
But by the way you've been
looking at your hero...

1405
01:53:51,362 --> 01:53:55,913
...I wonder, would you
let him die for you?

1406
01:53:56,533 --> 01:53:58,603
Open it, Sophie, to save his life.

1407
01:53:58,911 --> 01:54:00,867
- Leigh, you can't just...
- Open the cryptex.

1408
01:54:01,705 --> 01:54:02,660
I don't know how.

1409
01:54:02,915 --> 01:54:04,746
Open it or he dies.

1410
01:54:05,042 --> 01:54:06,839
- I swear, I don't know.
- Do it! Do it!

1411
01:54:07,127 --> 01:54:08,355
- Stop it!
- I don't know!

1412
01:54:08,628 --> 01:54:09,902
Stop it!

1413
01:54:15,552 --> 01:54:17,429
She can't do it, Leigh.

1414
01:54:29,565 --> 01:54:31,283
But give me a moment.

1415
01:54:41,577 --> 01:54:43,135
Robert.

1416
01:54:56,383 --> 01:54:57,418
What are you doing?

1417
01:54:58,301 --> 01:54:59,416
Please.

1418
01:56:19,671 --> 01:56:21,070
I'm sorry.

1419
01:56:31,307 --> 01:56:32,342
I'm sorry.

1420
01:56:35,394 --> 01:56:36,747
No!

1421
01:56:44,862 --> 01:56:45,977
No, Robert!

1422
01:56:47,030 --> 01:56:48,258
No!

1423
01:56:49,157 --> 01:56:50,112
No.

1424
01:56:50,701 --> 01:56:52,771
Oh, the map. It's ruined.

1425
01:57:00,335 --> 01:57:01,734
The map is ruined.

1426
01:57:02,712 --> 01:57:03,986
The Grail.

1427
01:57:04,672 --> 01:57:05,741
It's lost.

1428
01:57:06,507 --> 01:57:07,906
The Grail is gone.

1429
01:57:08,342 --> 01:57:10,936
Only the worthy
find the Grail, Leigh.

1430
01:57:12,179 --> 01:57:13,658
You taught me that.

1431
01:57:17,268 --> 01:57:18,303
Armed police!

1432
01:57:18,561 --> 01:57:20,791
Drop it! Drop your weapon!

1433
01:57:21,230 --> 01:57:22,549
Put the gun down.

1434
01:57:25,359 --> 01:57:27,589
Put the gun down.

1435
01:57:32,449 --> 01:57:35,043
That one. The old man.

1436
01:57:35,368 --> 01:57:36,323
You're under arrest!

1437
01:57:36,578 --> 01:57:38,694
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense...

1438
01:57:38,997 --> 01:57:40,794
...if you do not mention,
when questioned...

1439
01:57:41,082 --> 01:57:42,993
...something which you
later rely on in court.

1440
01:57:43,293 --> 01:57:45,761
Anything you do say
will be given in evidence.

1441
01:57:56,639 --> 01:57:58,834
I'll have some questions for you.

1442
01:58:16,491 --> 01:58:20,040
Robert! Robert! Robert!
How could you do it?

1443
01:58:20,412 --> 01:58:22,482
How could you? Robert!

1444
01:58:22,997 --> 01:58:25,192
To destroy our hope of freedom.

1445
01:58:25,708 --> 01:58:28,859
To deny every pilgrim the chance
to kneel at the tomb of the Magdalene.

1446
01:58:29,212 --> 01:58:30,361
How could you?

1447
01:58:35,134 --> 01:58:37,011
You couldn't! You solved it.

1448
01:58:39,555 --> 01:58:42,865
You took the scroll out
before it broke!

1449
01:58:43,225 --> 01:58:47,013
You solved it. Oh, you'll find it, Robert.
You'll find it. You know what to do.

1450
01:58:47,396 --> 01:58:49,512
You'll find the Grail,
you'll kneel before her...

1451
01:58:49,815 --> 01:58:51,771
...and you'll set her free
upon the world!

1452
01:58:52,067 --> 01:58:55,298
That man there,
he's got the map to the Holy Grail!

1453
01:59:05,997 --> 01:59:10,673
There was every orb conceivable
on that tomb except one:

1454
01:59:11,836 --> 01:59:15,795
The orb which fell from the heavens
and inspired Newton's life's work.

1455
01:59:16,173 --> 01:59:20,849
Work that incurred the wrath
of the Church until his dying day.

1456
01:59:24,348 --> 01:59:25,747
A-P-P-L-E.

1457
01:59:26,892 --> 01:59:28,120
Apple.

1458
01:59:42,699 --> 01:59:45,577
<i>The Holy Grail 'neath</i>
<i>ancient Roslin waits</i>

1459
01:59:45,910 --> 01:59:48,140
<i>The blade and chalice</i>
<i>guarding o'er her gates</i>

1460
01:59:48,454 --> 01:59:50,410
<i>Adorned in masters'</i>
<i>loving art, she lies</i>

1461
01:59:50,706 --> 01:59:54,415
<i>She rests at last</i>
<i>beneath the starry skies</i>

1462
01:59:56,212 --> 01:59:58,089
I think I know where she's gone.

1463
01:59:59,048 --> 02:00:01,482
I think the Grail has gone home.

1464
02:00:21,444 --> 02:00:26,074
Built by the Templars themselves.
Named for the original Rose Line.

1465
02:00:26,491 --> 02:00:28,322
Rosslyn Chapel.

1466
02:00:29,494 --> 02:00:31,166
So this is it.

1467
02:00:32,246 --> 02:00:34,077
The gift at the end.

1468
02:00:35,082 --> 02:00:38,677
"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits."

1469
02:00:39,753 --> 02:00:42,870
You never told me the joke
Saunière made of you.

1470
02:00:43,257 --> 02:00:44,485
What was it?

1471
02:00:45,092 --> 02:00:46,923
He called me a flatfoot.

1472
02:00:47,302 --> 02:00:49,452
A beat cop of history.

1473
02:00:50,305 --> 02:00:52,296
Oh, a dumb policeman...

1474
02:00:52,599 --> 02:00:55,830
...who just does his job
day after day, of history.

1475
02:00:56,186 --> 02:00:59,781
You know, his father was one.
A policeman.

1476
02:01:00,607 --> 02:01:05,123
Saunière said he was the most
honorable man he had ever known.

1477
02:01:09,198 --> 02:01:11,758
We are who we protect, I think.

1478
02:01:12,785 --> 02:01:14,457
What we stand up for.

1479
02:01:26,465 --> 02:01:27,784
Jewish...

1480
02:01:28,967 --> 02:01:31,561
...Christian, Egyptian...

1481
02:01:32,971 --> 02:01:35,280
...Masonic, pagan...

1482
02:01:36,475 --> 02:01:38,113
...Templar crosses...

1483
02:01:38,810 --> 02:01:40,129
...pyramids.

1484
02:01:40,979 --> 02:01:44,608
I think I've been here before.

1485
02:01:44,983 --> 02:01:46,052
<i>Sophie.</i>

1486
02:02:06,003 --> 02:02:07,595
A very long time ago.

1487
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:11,720
Come along, Sophie.

1488
02:02:27,065 --> 02:02:28,100
Sophie.

1489
02:02:29,192 --> 02:02:30,261
Over here.

1490
02:02:38,034 --> 02:02:41,504
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates."

1491
02:02:42,037 --> 02:02:44,346
Pagan symbols for
male and female.

1492
02:02:46,458 --> 02:02:48,130
Fused as one.

1493
02:02:48,669 --> 02:02:50,660
As the pagans would have wanted.

1494
02:02:52,381 --> 02:02:54,053
We're about to close, I'm afraid.

1495
02:03:00,388 --> 02:03:02,583
We're just gonna be a moment.

1496
02:03:17,738 --> 02:03:18,966
Robert.

1497
02:03:45,014 --> 02:03:47,972
"Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies."

1498
02:03:48,685 --> 02:03:54,237
"She rests at last
beneath the starry skies."

1499
02:04:13,292 --> 02:04:14,884
The fleur-de-lis.

1500
02:05:06,051 --> 02:05:07,006
She was here.

1501
02:05:10,179 --> 02:05:11,692
Her sarcophagus.

1502
02:05:13,850 --> 02:05:15,408
Mary Magdalene.

1503
02:05:17,186 --> 02:05:19,097
The Holy Grail herself.

1504
02:05:20,773 --> 02:05:22,252
She was here.

1505
02:05:22,525 --> 02:05:24,083
Where did she go?

1506
02:05:25,194 --> 02:05:27,424
Did the Church finally get her?

1507
02:05:42,127 --> 02:05:44,561
This is incredible. Look at this.

1508
02:05:44,879 --> 02:05:48,030
Look at this. These records
go back thousands of years.

1509
02:05:49,425 --> 02:05:52,144
They date back
to the death of Christ.

1510
02:05:54,555 --> 02:05:57,786
Good God, could these
really be the Grail documents?

1511
02:06:19,996 --> 02:06:24,069
What did he want from us?
To find her sarcophagus?

1512
02:06:25,251 --> 02:06:27,845
How was I ever supposed
to figure all this out?

1513
02:06:28,421 --> 02:06:30,696
When you and your
grandfather fought...

1514
02:06:31,007 --> 02:06:33,601
...was it something about your past?

1515
02:06:35,553 --> 02:06:37,225
How could you know that?

1516
02:06:38,014 --> 02:06:40,608
About how your parents died?

1517
02:06:41,767 --> 02:06:43,325
Sophie?

1518
02:06:45,688 --> 02:06:47,804
It was during primary school.

1519
02:06:49,525 --> 02:06:51,436
I was in his library.

1520
02:06:53,320 --> 02:06:54,753
Doing research.

1521
02:06:55,030 --> 02:06:57,544
<i>I was trying to find out</i>
<i>about my family.</i>

1522
02:06:57,866 --> 02:06:59,982
Sophie, where are you, princess?

1523
02:07:00,952 --> 02:07:03,147
I wanted to know about them.

1524
02:07:03,955 --> 02:07:05,832
But I couldn't find any records.

1525
02:07:07,125 --> 02:07:08,922
Not of their death...

1526
02:07:10,461 --> 02:07:12,258
...not of the accident.

1527
02:07:13,006 --> 02:07:15,236
<i>I'd asked him for as long</i>
<i>as I could remember...</i>

1528
02:07:15,550 --> 02:07:16,778
<i>... but he would never tell me.</i>

1529
02:07:17,051 --> 02:07:18,643
I told you, no.

1530
02:07:21,180 --> 02:07:22,533
But why can't I?

1531
02:07:22,973 --> 02:07:24,725
He stood over me...

1532
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:28,516
...and he wouldn't let me leave.

1533
02:07:28,812 --> 02:07:30,530
They're dead. Dead and buried.

1534
02:07:31,148 --> 02:07:32,706
Never look for them, Sophie.

1535
02:07:33,066 --> 02:07:34,181
Promise me.

1536
02:07:35,736 --> 02:07:36,725
Swear it!

1537
02:07:37,571 --> 02:07:38,606
Swear it to me!

1538
02:07:49,332 --> 02:07:51,209
I kept my promise.

1539
02:07:54,962 --> 02:07:57,635
The next week he sent me
to boarding school.

1540
02:07:59,467 --> 02:08:02,664
<i>One weekend</i>
<i>I came home unexpectedly.</i>

1541
02:08:03,971 --> 02:08:06,644
<i>And what I saw</i>
<i>my grandfather doing...</i>

1542
02:08:07,725 --> 02:08:09,238
<i>Some ritual.</i>

1543
02:08:11,353 --> 02:08:12,866
<i>I was so frightened.</i>

1544
02:08:17,651 --> 02:08:19,721
We hardly ever spoke again.

1545
02:08:23,532 --> 02:08:28,367
Do you have any memories of your
grandfather before the accident?

1546
02:08:29,662 --> 02:08:31,732
Before your parents were killed?

1547
02:08:32,540 --> 02:08:35,008
Yeah. No. I don't know.

1548
02:08:36,294 --> 02:08:37,329
Why?

1549
02:08:40,173 --> 02:08:42,403
Because I don't think
he was your grandfather.

1550
02:09:02,027 --> 02:09:03,904
These are my parents.

1551
02:09:06,156 --> 02:09:07,430
My brother.

1552
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:10,838
And this is you, isn't it?

1553
02:09:15,957 --> 02:09:19,472
The paper says
the entire family was killed.

1554
02:09:20,127 --> 02:09:23,802
The mother, the father, the boy, 6...

1555
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:27,950
...and the girl, 4.

1556
02:09:29,678 --> 02:09:34,069
But your name was never Saunière.
It's Saint-Clair.

1557
02:09:37,728 --> 02:09:39,878
It's one of the oldest families
in France.

1558
02:09:40,731 --> 02:09:44,280
It's from a line of the
Merovingian kings.

1559
02:09:53,076 --> 02:09:54,794
Royal blood.

1560
02:09:56,913 --> 02:09:58,426
I was so wrong.

1561
02:10:00,124 --> 02:10:04,242
Saunière didn't want you to help guard
the secret of the Holy Grail.

1562
02:10:06,172 --> 02:10:07,400
Sophie...

1563
02:10:10,009 --> 02:10:12,045
...you are the secret.

1564
02:10:13,512 --> 02:10:15,867
You survived the accident.

1565
02:10:16,265 --> 02:10:18,779
If it even was an accident.

1566
02:10:19,101 --> 02:10:20,932
The Priory found out.

1567
02:10:21,645 --> 02:10:24,682
Somehow they concealed
the fact that you were alive.

1568
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:28,591
They hid you with the
Grand Master himself...

1569
02:10:29,277 --> 02:10:31,347
...who raised you as his own.

1570
02:10:32,489 --> 02:10:34,207
According to all of this...

1571
02:10:35,825 --> 02:10:37,383
...Princess Sophie...

1572
02:10:41,247 --> 02:10:42,646
...you are the heir.

1573
02:10:45,042 --> 02:10:46,839
The end of the bloodline.

1574
02:10:48,587 --> 02:10:51,704
You are the last living descendent...

1575
02:10:53,008 --> 02:10:54,805
...of Jesus Christ.

1576
02:11:40,345 --> 02:11:41,619
What is this?

1577
02:11:43,724 --> 02:11:44,918
Sophie?

1578
02:11:48,186 --> 02:11:49,221
Who are you?

1579
02:11:49,479 --> 02:11:51,834
There have been many names.

1580
02:11:52,482 --> 02:11:54,200
The keepers.

1581
02:11:55,151 --> 02:11:56,550
Guardians.

1582
02:11:57,028 --> 02:11:59,178
The Priory of Sion.

1583
02:11:59,655 --> 02:12:04,729
But to you, Sophie, we are friends
of the man who raised you:

1584
02:12:05,411 --> 02:12:06,969
Jacques Saunière.

1585
02:12:09,457 --> 02:12:14,531
He would have wanted you to know
that he loved you very much.

1586
02:12:15,713 --> 02:12:19,501
And that the Priory are here
to protect you now...

1587
02:12:19,883 --> 02:12:22,920
...as they have always
protected our family.

1588
02:12:25,680 --> 02:12:27,636
I gave you up once...

1589
02:12:28,516 --> 02:12:31,428
...knowing I might
never see you again.

1590
02:12:35,023 --> 02:12:36,820
I'm your grandmother, Sophie.

1591
02:12:38,109 --> 02:12:43,183
I have prayed for this moment
for a very long time.

1592
02:12:45,116 --> 02:12:47,152
Welcome home, child.

1593
02:13:00,088 --> 02:13:01,077
Hey.

1594
02:13:11,599 --> 02:13:15,592
She has some things
she wants to tell me.

1595
02:13:16,604 --> 02:13:18,834
About my family.

1596
02:13:25,321 --> 02:13:26,390
What will you do?

1597
02:13:27,615 --> 02:13:31,164
The legend will be revealed
when the heir reveals himself.

1598
02:13:32,161 --> 02:13:34,470
They just got the pronoun wrong.

1599
02:13:37,916 --> 02:13:39,554
She said when Saunière died...

1600
02:13:39,835 --> 02:13:43,430
...he took the location
of Mary's sarcophagus with him.

1601
02:13:43,797 --> 02:13:47,551
So there's no way to empirically prove
that I am related to her.

1602
02:13:49,886 --> 02:13:51,717
What would you do, Robert?

1603
02:13:52,806 --> 02:13:56,845
Okay, maybe there is no proof.
Maybe the Grail is lost forever.

1604
02:13:57,227 --> 02:14:01,300
But, Sophie, the only thing that
matters is what you believe.

1605
02:14:02,482 --> 02:14:05,360
History shows us
Jesus was an extraordinary man...

1606
02:14:05,693 --> 02:14:07,570
...a human inspiration. That's it.

1607
02:14:08,529 --> 02:14:11,089
That's all the evidence
has ever proved.

1608
02:14:12,741 --> 02:14:13,776
But...

1609
02:14:14,827 --> 02:14:16,579
...when I was a boy...

1610
02:14:19,081 --> 02:14:23,359
When I was down in that well
Teabing told you about...

1611
02:14:26,171 --> 02:14:28,810
...I thought I was going to die,
Sophie.

1612
02:14:30,884 --> 02:14:32,283
What I did...

1613
02:14:33,053 --> 02:14:34,372
...I prayed.

1614
02:14:35,930 --> 02:14:39,843
I prayed to Jesus to keep me alive...

1615
02:14:40,226 --> 02:14:41,898
...so I could see my parents again...

1616
02:14:42,186 --> 02:14:44,620
...so I could go to school again...

1617
02:14:45,189 --> 02:14:47,339
...so I could play with my dog.

1618
02:14:48,859 --> 02:14:52,010
Sometimes I wonder
if I wasn't alone down there.

1619
02:14:54,073 --> 02:14:56,667
Why does it have to be
human or divine?

1620
02:14:56,992 --> 02:14:58,789
Maybe human is divine.

1621
02:15:00,204 --> 02:15:01,956
Why couldn't Jesus
have been a father...

1622
02:15:02,247 --> 02:15:04,920
...and still been capable
of all those miracles?

1623
02:15:05,375 --> 02:15:07,889
Like turning water into wine?

1624
02:15:08,378 --> 02:15:11,848
Well, who knows?
His blood is your blood.

1625
02:15:12,215 --> 02:15:15,127
Maybe that junkie in the park
will never touch a drug again.

1626
02:15:15,927 --> 02:15:18,805
Maybe you healed my phobia
with your hands.

1627
02:15:19,138 --> 02:15:22,130
And maybe you're
a knight on a Grail quest.

1628
02:15:24,977 --> 02:15:27,616
Well, here's the question:

1629
02:15:28,481 --> 02:15:31,075
A living descendent
of Jesus Christ...

1630
02:15:32,735 --> 02:15:35,124
...would she destroy faith?

1631
02:15:35,821 --> 02:15:39,336
Or would she renew it?

1632
02:15:41,285 --> 02:15:44,402
So again I say, what matters
is what you believe.

1633
02:15:46,790 --> 02:15:48,018
Thank you.

1634
02:15:50,252 --> 02:15:51,401
For bringing me here.

1635
02:15:53,672 --> 02:15:56,061
For letting him choose you...

1636
02:15:56,883 --> 02:15:58,032
...Sir Robert.

1637
02:16:08,311 --> 02:16:09,266
You take care.

1638
02:16:10,938 --> 02:16:12,007
Yes.

1639
02:16:36,755 --> 02:16:37,824
Hey.

1640
02:16:50,810 --> 02:16:51,765
Nope.

1641
02:16:53,145 --> 02:16:55,295
Maybe I'll do better with the wine.

1642
02:16:58,942 --> 02:17:00,261
Godspeed.

1643
02:17:59,083 --> 02:18:00,311
Bloodline.

1644
02:18:03,921 --> 02:18:05,195
Rose Line.

1645
02:18:12,054 --> 02:18:13,806
"Hides beneath the Rose."

1646
02:19:05,939 --> 02:19:09,375
<i>"The Holy Grail 'neath</i>
<i>ancient Roslin waits.</i>

1647
02:19:12,612 --> 02:19:15,843
<i>Adorned in masters'</i>
<i>loving art, she lies.</i>

1648
02:19:32,048 --> 02:19:35,518
<i>The blade and chalice</i>
<i>guarding o'er her gates.</i>

1649
02:20:15,214 --> 02:20:18,809
<i>She rests at last</i>
<i>beneath starry skies."</i>
