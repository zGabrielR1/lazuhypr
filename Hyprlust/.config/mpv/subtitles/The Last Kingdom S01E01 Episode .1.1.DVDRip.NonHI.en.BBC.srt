1
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,178
<i>Boy!</i>

2
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:13,077
<i>The tide is on the turn.</i>

3
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,213
I'm not warning you again!

4
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:21,749
<i>Ships! There!</i>

5
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,626
Danes...

6
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:32,132
The devil's turds.

7
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,566
- Are they traders?
<i>- No!</i>

8
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,126
They come as Vikings!

9
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,502
We go!

10
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,005
<i>Go! Go!</i>

11
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,514
Where's my son?

12
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:34,289
Uhtred, take half a dozen
men and ride to the river.

13
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:36,024
There are pagans
there, you watch them,

14
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:37,895
- see how many they are.
- Course, Father.

15
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,208
Do nothing more, you understand?

16
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,497
- Yes, Father.
- Osbert, what is it?

17
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:44,130
- Ships. I saw them first from the beach.
- What ships?

18
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:46,606
Danes! There
heading for the river.

19
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,805
Oh, God and his saints
preserve us, they have no soul.

20
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,676
- We must pray.
- We must act.

21
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,740
Uhtred. Do not fight
them, not a single one.

22
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,478
- And be back by nightfall.
- Yes, Father.

23
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,146
They are sent by God
to punish us, for our sins.

24
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:01,086
Our sins be damned,

25
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,665
they are here to support
the Viking army in Eoferwic.

26
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,101
- Aelfric!
- You must instruct the priest
to pray for our deliverance.

27
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,684
- Aelfric!
- Lord?

28
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,395
Get them inside.

29
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,556
We take in as many
women and elders as we can.

30
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,623
The rest go to higher
ground and out of sight.

31
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,500
Send word to rouse the country. I
want every man inside this fortress.

32
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,697
And every man must
be prepared to die.

33
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,265
<i>Port side ready to row.</i>

34
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,102
<i>Port side ready to row.</i>

35
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,450
<i>Starboard side ready to row.</i>

36
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,594
<i>Starboard side ready to row.</i>

37
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,205
Father.

38
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,649
<i>Let's go.</i>

39
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,315
Taste.

40
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,026
Ah, fresh sweet water.

41
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,294
Yes. What else do you see?

42
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:58,194
I see a clear river, with
fish as big as a man's leg.

43
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,332
I see a forest alive with meat.

44
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,933
But more than that I see
a place to grow fat and old.

45
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,243
Horses.

46
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,581
Yeah, and I see spies,
shitting themselves.

47
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,019
<i>Yeah!</i>

48
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,960
We'll meet sword with sword!

49
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,434
<i>You're pagans! We have
the greater god on our side.</i>

50
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:31,029
Kjartan. I think we should
teach this boy a lesson.

51
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,505
<i>Taking her in.</i>

52
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,770
At speed!

53
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,485
<i>Why do I leave the villages
unprotected and bring the men inside?</i>

54
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,762
Is that your question?

55
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,098
A village can be rebuilt,

56
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,228
a warrior can die only once.

57
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,739
The Danes are maybe
heading south to Eoferwic,

58
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,037
but they will kill whoever
they can on the way.

59
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,805
Now, go find the priest.

60
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,177
Yes, Father.

61
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:25,024
<i>Come in, Osbert, don't
skulk in the shadows.</i>

62
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,289
<i>He, er, wants to
know if you're ready.</i>

63
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,262
Almost.

64
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,060
Do you know what
I am tasked with?

65
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,227
Erm, a letter?

66
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,395
A response to a letter,
this letter. From King Aella,

67
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:41,008
asking your father for
his support, his army,

68
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,136
to help recapture
the city of Eoferwic.

69
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,772
This is why it's important for
you to be able to read and write.

70
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,338
Father can't read nor write.

71
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,577
Yeah, well, for your
father it's too late.

72
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:53,280
King Aella could have
sent a man on horseback.

73
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,017
Yeah, but who's to say the man
on horseback speaks the truth?

74
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,992
Or has remembered
the true message?

75
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:03,292
What these letters will
represent is history, facts...

76
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,494
Your father is informing
King Aella, and King Osbert,

77
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,867
he will be alongside
their armies at Eoferwic.

78
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:13,840
And the mark of Bebbanburg
will guarantee the truth of it.

79
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,467
Why do we fight for Eoferwic?

80
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:19,570
Well, we fight for Eoferwic because
we do not wish to see England,

81
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,844
piece by piece, become Daneland.

82
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,846
I heard it said that
we were pagans once,

83
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,355
that Woden and
Odin are the same.

84
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,914
We saw the error of our
ways and we looked to Rome.

85
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,825
I heard the pagans
had fierce gods of war.

86
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,920
Well, we are right
and they are mistaken.

87
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,397
Osbert, we are blessed.

88
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,662
I should make you swear
on St Cuthbert's comb

89
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,033
never to mention the
likes of Woden again.

90
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,096
But what if I had a
hound called Woden?

91
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,350
What if I didn't, what
would you do then?

92
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,584
- You have not.
- What would you do then?

93
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,952
What if you had
a pig called Thor?

94
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,320
Come, let's go see
your father. Come.

95
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,869
A pig called Thor.

96
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,882
Is it really St Cuthbert's comb?

97
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:59,216
Of course it's St Cuthbert's comb, and his
holy hair lies in the teeth of that comb.

98
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,650
Where was your father last?

99
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,554
He was humping the servant girl.

100
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,218
- That is a lie, Osbert.
- No.

101
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,090
Are you never
gonna tire of teasing?

102
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,494
Nope.

103
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,622
<i>Horsemen approaching!</i>

104
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,444
He rides Uhtred's horse.

105
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,688
Osbert.

106
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,275
No. No!

107
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,060
Bury what's left of him.

108
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,565
Osbert. Come on.

109
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,173
Remind me of the last
words I spoke to him.

110
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:32,577
You told him to watch and do not fight,
we have no idea of the circumstance...

111
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,013
- Do not fight means do not fight.
- He was young.

112
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,288
<i>There was no fight to
be had until Eoferwic.</i>

113
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,445
You wanted to see
Osbert, My Lord.

114
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,217
You...

115
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,781
You are now called Uhtred.
Uhtred, son of Uhtred.

116
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,383
You have your stone, the amber?

117
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,553
Yes, Father.

118
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,405
The priest will show you
your history, the parchments.

119
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:50,829
Make him understand who he is.

120
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,891
<i>Lord, I, I should like
to baptise him again.</i>

121
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,129
Well, if he arrives at
Heaven's gate as Uhtred,

122
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,001
they may wonder what's
happened to Osbert.

123
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,406
Do what you must,
but do as I ask.

124
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,966
<i>Lord.</i>

125
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,336
We were kings here once, boy.

126
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,241
Kings of all the land between
the Rivers Tuede and Tine.

127
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,841
And we should be kings again.

128
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,995
Yes we should, but it doesn't
matter what they call us,

129
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,783
so long as they obey.

130
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,689
Our ancestors took this land,

131
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,250
and it has been strengthened
with our blood and bone.

132
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,991
And now you are the new heir
of Bebbanburg, do you hear me?

133
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,760
And you will die
for it if needed.

134
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,892
Yes, Father.

135
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,145
And I will give you the head
of the man who killed Uhtred.

136
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,161
No, you are Uhtred!

137
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,332
Have you not been
listening to me?

138
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,775
Do not tell me what it is you
will do, you are just a pup!

139
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,508
You will give me nothing, you
will watch and you will learn!

140
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,747
Put him in the water before his
mother's tongue gives me grief.

141
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,152
She's not my mother.

142
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,855
Will you take him with you
to battle to watch and learn?

143
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,361
- He's old enough.
- I need you to choose 30 men

144
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:59,230
and remain here at Bebbanburg.
Protect the boy, he is the heir.

145
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,970
Thirty will hold and is few enough
to feed. Will you do this for me?

146
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,247
I'd rather be with
you at Eoferwic,

147
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,240
- but I'll do as you ask.
- Thank you.

148
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,746
Come on quickly,
up there, go on.

149
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,517
<i>Hurry, please.</i>

150
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:32,158
<i>Heavenly Father,
receive your servant</i>

151
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:36,636
<i>Uhtred into the
Holy Kind of Saints</i>

152
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,571
<i>and into the ranks of
the most bright angels.</i>

153
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,068
Let your holy waters cleanse him

154
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,375
and make and him
worthy of your blessing,

155
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,613
<i>make him your
instrument and your rod.</i>

156
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:57,819
Let him realise the
significance of the written word

157
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,554
so he may learn of your glory

158
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,028
and in turn may
spread your word.

159
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:07,333
- Beo...
- Let him grow in wisdom

160
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,332
and in respect.

161
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,896
- Beo...
- So he may lead in a Godly manner.

162
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,965
Beocca, he's cleansed.

163
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,034
Amen.

164
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,841
Uhtred, son of
Uhtred of Bebbanburg,

165
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,678
welcome to the Christian world.

166
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,378
Behold your people
and your lands.

167
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,622
Where are the
people? The soldiers?

168
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,494
On the road to Eoferwic,
led by your father,

169
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:14,057
where he will join the other
two kings of Northumbria.

170
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,398
Without me?

171
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:18,200
You are to remain at
Bebbanburg with your kindly uncle.

172
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,216
I am sworn to keep you
safe. Should you wish to fight

173
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,117
- we can always arm-wrestle.
- Where's the priest?

174
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,042
With your father. Eat.

175
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,808
You have work to do,
Uhtred, in the stables.

176
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:30,613
Thankfully, we've
been left horses.

177
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,676
<i>- You should eat.
- I'm not hungry.</i>

178
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:35,245
We have work to do,
horse shit to shovel.

179
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,782
Come and find me
when you've finished.

180
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,863
Scallion...

181
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,166
If my brother falls in battle,

182
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,506
the boy must fall.

183
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,939
All this way and
no reception party.

184
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,016
- Earl Ragnar.
- Guthrum.

185
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,913
- How are you?
- I'm fine, I'm hungry.

186
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,390
- And your boy?
- He's coming.

187
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,723
- Ragnar.
- Ubba, I brought men and horses.

188
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,695
Good to see you. Are you well?

189
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:28,468
You made a gift of
his own son's head?

190
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,094
How did this lord react?

191
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,502
He did nothing.

192
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,701
He brought his warriors into
the fortress, kept them inside.

193
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,642
It was not cowardice.

194
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,043
Restraint.

195
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,011
He's saving his men.

196
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,777
That man is Uhtred.

197
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,512
One of the three kings of
Northumbria. A warrior king.

198
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,511
The other two are fools, they'd
rather be here fighting each other.

199
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,491
- This is true?
- King Aella and King Osbert,

200
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:56,292
they, er, both lay
claim to Eoferwic.

201
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,821
They have the
strangest of names.

202
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:01,164
So, when do we fight?

203
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,998
Soon, I hope.

204
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,671
I'm still to decide.

205
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:13,643
Fools or not, they
have three armies,

206
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,708
- they have numbers. EARL
RAGNAR: <i>But are divided.</i>

207
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,449
Three kings, but only one
who can lead them, this Uhtred.

208
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,287
And we kill him and
Northumbria is ours,

209
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,190
all of it.

210
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,988
Listen to him, listen to the
boy, he reminds me of me.

211
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,466
Yeah, when you were younger.

212
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,436
Of course when I was
younger. He's just a boy.

213
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,995
- Just saying. EARL
RAGNAR: Ubba.

214
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,631
Did you say I was old?

215
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,574
Storri... I'm not getting old.
- No.

216
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,909
Ubba, I have seen the
land outside the city.

217
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,348
I have a plan in
mind, a good plan.

218
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,511
And my son would like
to wet his sword with you.

219
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,316
So do we fight?

220
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,488
Storri?

221
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:02,585
The signs are good.

222
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,121
Only this morning I saw a
raven fly towards the Saxon camp

223
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,532
and he was asking me
to follow, I'm sure of it.

224
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,002
Mmm.

225
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,937
Then we fight.

226
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,464
<i>What kind of hell is this?</i>

227
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,098
It's a pagan's hell.

228
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,869
We out number them.

229
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,877
No, there are more,
there must be...

230
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,778
Nothing changes, we
attack with half our number,

231
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:56,612
the second half to follow once
we have the measure of them.

232
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,515
They have conceded
to higher ground.

233
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:02,682
<i>Kingaler, yours and Lord Uhtred's
army will attack in the first wave.</i>

234
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,157
<i>Prepare! Prepare!</i>

235
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,061
Shield!

236
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,024
No. No, not without me.

237
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:38,919
Come nightfall, we'll
be rid of this plague!

238
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,553
And counting our
share of the plunder!

239
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,757
My shield.

240
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,704
Kill them all!

241
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,492
<i>The wall is holding.</i>

242
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,590
Go! Hands below
your shield and drive!

243
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,294
Drive on!

244
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:31,562
Ease.

245
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,470
<i>Ease!</i>

246
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,070
<i>Ease!</i>

247
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,079
<i>Ease!</i>

248
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,980
Push. Keep
pushing! It's working!

249
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,249
Drive them!

250
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,630
<i>They're tiring, they
can't fight back.</i>

251
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,136
We're winning,
look! We're winning...

252
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:17,675
Not yet!

253
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,134
Dear God, no.

254
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,304
Shield!

255
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,208
Wall!

256
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,112
Dear God of infinite
mercy, not this.

257
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,144
Kill them all!

258
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:10,593
<i>Legs! Legs! Protect your legs!</i>

259
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:15,506
Lift up your sword and spare these
men of England who fight in your name.

260
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:20,510
Let the heathen's hearts
crumble and wither.

261
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:24,278
<i>Restore your power upon
these men of England,</i>

262
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:27,514
<i>so they can glorify your name
with the blood of the devils.</i>

263
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,384
Have mercy now, Lord.

264
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,723
Do not forsake us, do
not forsake England.

265
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,768
Follow me! Follow me!

266
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,305
Take him!

267
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:58,578
<i>Close the sealed wall,
close the wall and take him!</i>

268
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,322
No!

269
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,469
He's like a wasp.

270
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:32,378
The wasp has lost its sting.
- Yeah.

271
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,224
Are you sure he's a
Saxon? He fights like a Dane.

272
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:47,495
Yeah.

273
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,504
Leave her.

274
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,040
She is to live.

275
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,682
Some of these young
ones can come in useful.

276
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:47,155
Father, there's
the boy I spoke of.

277
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,024
The one who almost killed you?

278
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:51,361
You're leaving him with me?

279
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:53,764
I've never seen a man
get the better of you yet.

280
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:12,341
Cut me some chicken.

281
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,485
Careful, the blade is sharp.

282
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,223
It can kill a man.

283
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,305
The chicken is on your platter.

284
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,038
- Hmm.
- Have you always been blind?

285
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:46,084
Oh, I see enough.

286
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:49,816
So who have they
been killing below?

287
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,685
<i>Prisoners.</i>

288
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:58,288
Just now, a king.

289
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,560
Did he die well?

290
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,866
No.

291
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,166
Then he shouldn't
have been king.

292
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,407
<i>Tell me,</i>

293
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,036
who sits in the
middle of the hall?

294
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,211
Is it a big man and a small man?

295
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:24,421
Yes and a grey man
sits in between them.

296
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:28,860
If you get to live, you should
beware of the big man, Ubba.

297
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,559
My advice for you is

298
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:34,590
to never cross Ubba

299
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,898
and never, never fight him.

300
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,267
If I get to live?

301
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:41,273
He listens to no
one but the gods.

302
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,537
Men who take their orders

303
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:46,739
from the gods are unpredictable.

304
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:51,880
What did you mean,

305
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,476
when you said if I get to live?

306
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,010
You're my prisoner.

307
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,415
The grey man will be Egbert,

308
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,085
he's a Saxon ealdorman.

309
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,562
He has pledged allegiance

310
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:07,191
and now he calls himself king.

311
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,929
He is king of nothing.

312
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:14,702
Soon, all of the kings in
England shall be kings of nothing.

313
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,337
Northumbria's ours.
Mercia will soon by ours.

314
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:22,644
Then East Anglia, Cornwallum,

315
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,479
and then the greatest prize

316
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,415
is the last Kingdom,

317
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:30,218
- Wessex.
- I've heard of Wessex.

318
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,747
Anything will grow in Wessex.

319
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,424
Tell me your name.

320
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:39,091
Uhtred.

321
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,464
I am the Ealdorman
of Bebbanburg.

322
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,627
You are?

323
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:44,796
I am, I own lands to the north.

324
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:47,432
How long have you been
an ealdorman of these lands?

325
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:57,774
Your father chose to fight us.

326
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,548
And is now... Dead.

327
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:08,054
He, he... He was not fond of me.

328
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:17,594
I now understand why
my son spared you,

329
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:21,606
Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

330
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,573
You are a warrior.

331
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:28,539
Have some ale.

332
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,347
Drink it,

333
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,351
lots of it.

334
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,494
Here, take it up there.

335
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:28,504
I'm thinking of
keeping them both,

336
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,203
the boy and the girl,
they can help your mother.

337
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,714
- Disagree?
- No.

338
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,808
But we did kill his father.

339
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:42,446
And if he is an ealdorman,
we could sell him for a ransom.

340
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:44,388
Perhaps.

341
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,882
<i>Brida, be careful
not to spill the water,</i>

342
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,050
you'll turn the floor to mud.

343
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,424
Uhtred, wood
needs to be chopped.

344
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:59,425
<i>Brida, you can do the goats.</i>

345
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,558
Will there be time
for Uhtred to play?

346
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,261
Only when work is done.

347
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:10,033
I don't like our daughter
having to play with the slaves.

348
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,600
They're only children.

349
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,043
They have a place.

350
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:14,706
Grumpy.

351
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:24,254
<i>- My horse.</i>
- Hey, Ragnar Ragnarson.

352
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,089
Hey, Uhtred of wherever.

353
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,095
How about you teach
me how to use a sword?

354
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,256
<i>We Don't teach
slaves how to fight.</i>

355
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,528
That tongue of yours
will be your death, boy.

356
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,725
Now, get back to work.

357
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:41,565
What does the play involve?

358
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:44,434
We built a hall in the gorge.

359
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,911
I'm the mistress and
Uhtred is a warrior.

360
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,538
Not a servant?

361
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,173
It is a game.

362
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:55,847
<i>A wolf! Uhtred.</i>

363
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,253
<i>That's it, a wolf.</i>

364
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:59,087
Boar! Watch out!

365
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:01,616
I saw it, its sharp
teeth and yellow eyes.

366
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,460
Don't let the wolves
get to me, Uhtred.

367
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:06,397
- Use the fire to keep them away.
- I see them.

368
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:09,026
They are as big as
Ubba and smell worse.

369
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:15,173
Did you see that?

370
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:20,810
<i>Uhtred?</i>

371
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:22,178
Stay up there.

372
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,239
Look.

373
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:26,985
Uhtred, what is happening?

374
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,145
Stay up there, Thyra.

375
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,212
It's Sven, he won't hurt you.

376
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,780
<i>But he'll kill us.</i>

377
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,157
He'll kill us! Run!

378
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:44,168
That was a real sword.

379
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,102
I saw it.

380
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:49,131
- Uhtred! Uhtred!
- Thyra!

381
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:14,597
What's this?

382
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,101
You been fighting again?

383
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,870
<i>Yes.</i>

384
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,463
With Sven?

385
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:21,996
Kjartan's son?

386
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,973
<i>Yes.</i>

387
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,638
- Uhtred, he's much bigger than you.
- He's a turd.

388
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,638
<i>Why do you say that?</i>
RAVN: <i>Who started it?</i>

389
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,010
Who began the fight?

390
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,450
<i>I began the fight.</i>

391
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:36,080
For no other reason
than that he's a turd?

392
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,685
Danes have murdered for less.

393
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,420
<i>Uhtred, that's enough.</i>

394
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,827
- Do you want to be sold, boy?
- I wish to eat.

395
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:45,956
- Speak up!
- I wish to eat.

396
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,329
You want to eat?

397
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:51,629
You want to eat?

398
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,166
<i>You know what?</i>

399
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:56,232
I say you starve.

400
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:59,073
Fighting is expected,
disobedience is not.

401
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,738
Sven began the fight.

402
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:04,448
<i>Kjartan!</i>

403
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:06,612
Kjartan!

404
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,386
Earl Ragnar, let me first
say, he's a, he's a good boy.

405
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:19,159
He brought this sword onto my
land. I will have words with him.

406
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:20,942
In time he'll serve on
your ship. He... He...

407
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,662
- He has offended me.
- He will honour you

408
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:25,261
- and he meant no harm, Lord.
- He meant no harm?

409
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,295
He looked at my
daughter's nakedness.

410
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,207
And he was punished.
Your Saxon slave cut him.

411
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:31,972
Shall I make a
square of branches?

412
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,105
Are you gonna fight me
for your son or fetch him?

413
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,151
Sven.

414
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,485
Come out here.

415
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,994
- Tell him what you have to say.
- I'm sorry.

416
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,928
- He can't hear you.
- I'm sorry, Lord.

417
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,430
For what I did.

418
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,736
You laid hands on my daughter.

419
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,336
You stripped her naked.

420
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,535
- Half naked, Lord.
- He is at an age, Lord.

421
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,942
Is this true? Half naked?

422
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,346
Yes, Lord.

423
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,079
Then I shall only
take his one eye.

424
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:20,354
No, no, please.

425
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:23,988
Kjartan, you are
banished from my land.

426
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,213
I have something for you.

427
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,989
What is it?

428
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,322
An amulet, Thor's hammer.

429
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:56,384
Ah, but, er...

430
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,953
But what?

431
00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:00,022
You're Christian.

432
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,466
Take it.

433
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,500
- I can't.
- Don't you want it?

434
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:08,939
I, I do want it.

435
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:10,465
- Take it.
- I'm trying.

436
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,320
- Take it. YOUNG RAGNAR:
I don't think he wants it.

437
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:13,835
I, I do want it.

438
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,678
No, I don't think so.

439
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,019
Thank you.

440
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,723
Tell me about Denmark.

441
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,623
Your home.

442
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:32,553
What can I say about Denmark?

443
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,865
It's wet.

444
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,926
And harsh.

445
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,598
Er, the ground is so flat

446
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,904
and sandy, you
can't grow a fart.

447
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,432
Which is why we're
here in England,

448
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:49,409
to grow, and why

449
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,814
Young Ragnar will
soon be going for Ireland.

450
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,443
You leave to fight?

451
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,554
To make my wealth.

452
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:59,990
If you want land or
silver, you have to take it.

453
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,053
You made me

454
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,327
proud today,

455
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,065
Uhtred.

456
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,227
You made me proud.

457
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:49,406
I don't know you, you don't have
the appearance of a messenger.

458
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:51,842
And Ubba's
payment's not yet due.

459
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:55,142
No, Lord, I was a ship's master.

460
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,776
Ah, well I have no ships,
I need no ship's master.

461
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,314
I have news that
you will want to hear.

462
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,260
- Well?
- I would want something in return, Lord.

463
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:12,389
Not now, not quite.

464
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:16,133
But perhaps we could
continue to help each other.

465
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,000
Perhaps.

466
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:21,165
Two days south of here.

467
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:23,334
This little rat with the
man I used to serve,

468
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,043
until he banished me.

469
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,113
He has a slave,

470
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:32,646
treats him well.

471
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:36,621
But this is a slave you are
entitled to buy back if you wish to.

472
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,751
Buy back?

473
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:42,226
It's your nephew Uhtred, Lord.

474
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,487
He lives.

475
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:03,340
What if I'm against
being ransomed?

476
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:07,614
Your family has discovered
that you're still alive

477
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,048
and they wish for
you to be returned,

478
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,821
but they must pay.

479
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,019
Pay Ragnar?

480
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,994
Ubba takes more than half.

481
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,655
It's normal.

482
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,327
But I have no family.

483
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,332
<i>Keep them over there,
tether the horses...</i>

484
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:38,747
Scallion, here.

485
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,647
Uhtred.

486
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,984
<i>They treating you well?</i>

487
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,514
I am fed, yes.

488
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:48,322
Good, good. That is all we ask.

489
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:52,594
And what is this around
your neck, some symbol?

490
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,462
Oh this. They make me wear it.

491
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:56,524
May I see it?

492
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:07,909
Look, I will speak plainly,
your uncle will kill you.

493
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:12,975
Right, you cannot go back to
Bebbanburg, you must escape.

494
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,212
He wants to be the ealdorman.

495
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:17,814
He wants to be the king, in fact,
like the pathetic Egbert over there.

496
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,519
A puppet king for
his Danish masters.

497
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,821
You should go to Wessex.

498
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,471
King Aethelred, real King Aethelred
and his brother the Prince Alfred,

499
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,896
they're good men,
good Christian men.

500
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:29,212
<i>That is enough
whispering in his ear, priest.</i>

501
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:32,470
- Uhtred.
- One more word

502
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,563
and I'll have your
ball-bag for a purse.

503
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:35,767
I'll meet you there.

504
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:37,400
That will not be necessary.

505
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,236
What did he say?

506
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:43,646
He... He asked if you
were treating me well.

507
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,561
<i>How much?</i> RAVN: <i>300.</i>

508
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,043
<i>That is a ridiculous amount.</i>

509
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,666
<i>How can a boy be worth
300 pieces of silver?</i>

510
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:12,108
Because I say so,

511
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,204
because he is a
lord, an ealdorman.

512
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,478
He is a boy. I am the
Ealdorman of Bebbanburg.

513
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,280
I carry the seal and the banner.

514
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:23,152
That seal is my father's,
which is now mine!

515
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:24,883
<i>You will be silent.</i>

516
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,482
You are for sale, nothing more.

517
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:27,492
For ransom, Lord.

518
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,187
- That's is what I said.
<i>- My Lords...</i>

519
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:32,254
I have given up land, horses.

520
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:35,028
I've offered a generous supply
of food as well as my sword.

521
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:38,969
All I ask in return is a fair
price for my only nephew.

522
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,529
<i>What would you
say is a fair price?</i>

523
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,473
<i>I will offer 100
pieces of silver.</i>

524
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:45,170
<i>200.</i>

525
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:48,737
My allegiance and 100
pieces is surely a fair price.

526
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,181
<i>It is not.</i>

527
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:56,078
I will give 120 pieces
of silver for the boy.

528
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,180
<i>Not enough.</i>

529
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:04,529
Very well, 200 pieces.

530
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,461
<i>I agree to your terms.</i>

531
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:20,273
- The boy's sold to Earl Ragnar.
- What?

532
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,076
- Ransomed, Lord.
- That's what I said.

533
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:24,912
So the matter is closed.

534
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,975
My Lords, I have
come a long way.

535
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:28,247
I have offered my allegiance.

536
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:30,187
Which is why you
are allowed to breathe.

537
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,388
If you have an argument,
it's with me now.

538
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:47,672
If business is done,
we have ale to drink.

539
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:51,142
And King Uhtred needs to sit.

540
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,513
<i>Am I not for ransom anymore?</i>

541
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,182
<i>You heard Ubba, I bought you.</i>

542
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,393
I thought I might
sacrifice you to Odin.

543
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:12,721
You bought me for how much?

544
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:15,757
- Too much.
- How much is too much?

545
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,666
My sword's weight in silver.

546
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,228
I agree, I may have been robbed,

547
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:24,106
but we like you, boy.
We're going to keep you.

548
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:27,007
Does this mean I'm a Dane?

549
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,014
It means you're
Uhtred Ragnarson.

550
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:32,112
You're a son to me now.

551
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:03,743
Brida, not that way.
Take the goat out the side.

552
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:05,682
Next time, I promise.

553
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:09,483
- Mother, look.
- It's beautiful, it really is.

554
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,614
I can't believe I'm
losing you already.

555
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:13,989
I will be living
across the field.

556
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,269
And if he does
not treat you well,

557
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:17,558
you just come marching
back across that field.

558
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,172
Oh, look at this place.

559
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:39,245
Uhtred, do you like
my wedding necklace?

560
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:42,578
I do, very pretty.

561
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,180
He doesn't know
anything about necklaces,

562
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:48,525
you might as well ask me.

563
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,586
Uhtred, with me. You can
help me slaughter the goats.

564
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,790
I've only just washed.

565
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,061
<i>The goats will be pleased.</i>

566
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:02,001
Later you can sweep the floor.

567
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:08,003
Move over.

568
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,747
It's an excuse
to talk, that's all.

569
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:17,880
With Thyra to be married, maybe
it's time you got together with Brida.

570
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:21,120
There are men, good
men, asking about her.

571
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:25,392
So you have to decide what you
are to her, what you are to each other.

572
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,694
- Brida has her own mind.
- She has.

573
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:30,725
But I see the way
she looks at you.

574
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:34,330
She's watching the
charcoal tonight in the woods.

575
00:44:35,306 --> 00:44:37,468
Take my horse and join her.

576
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:40,441
The earth will be warm.

577
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,746
Why not?

578
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,744
I just thought in order to be a
real Dane, I had to marry a Dane.

579
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:53,023
Come on.

580
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,987
I love you like I
love Young Ragnar.

581
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,053
What are you doing here?

582
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,976
Do you ever think
of your English life?

583
00:46:32,023 --> 00:46:34,083
Who you were before
we came to Ragnar?

584
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:38,489
No.

585
00:46:40,698 --> 00:46:42,064
Do you?

586
00:46:46,704 --> 00:46:48,434
- I think of who I...
- Shh.

587
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,076
<i>Voices.</i>

588
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,635
<i>Come on.</i>

589
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:56,613
Men, below...

590
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,091
<i>Come on, that way.</i>

591
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:15,293
Danes. Who are they?

592
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,632
<i>- This way.</i>
- That's Kjartan.

593
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:20,729
<i>Remember him?</i>

594
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,565
<i>And that must be Sven.</i>

595
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,607
This is wrong. We
need to tell Ragnar.

596
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:28,340
They are between us and hall.

597
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:31,178
Then we go up and around,
we leave the horses and run.

598
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:41,085
<i>In front of the door. That's it.</i>

599
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,441
<i>Ragnar, smoke!</i>

600
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:06,617
Fire! Thyra, wake up!

601
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,482
Odin, wake up!

602
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:10,181
<i>Fire!</i>

603
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,019
<i>Come on. Come on!</i>

604
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:23,524
This way, Ravn.
Come, come quickly.

605
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:29,573
The door is blocked!

606
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:31,098
So is this one!

607
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,507
Be ready.

608
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:42,049
<i>This one's open, this one's open!
Come on, follow me, this way!</i>

609
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,622
<i>This way. Take the children.</i>

610
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:58,799
<i>Don't go up there, wait for me!</i>

611
00:48:58,836 --> 00:49:00,361
<i>Come, come.</i>

612
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,270
Ragnar.

613
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:07,642
Close the doors. We have
Thyra, let the rest burn.

614
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:08,163
Take her with you to Valhalla.

615
00:50:08,906 --> 00:50:10,568
- Yes.
- I will meet you there.

616
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:08,632
Find the silver.

617
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,291
<i>Now!</i>

618
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,046
They're searching
for Ragnar's wealth.

619
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:29,544
- They'll never find it.
<i>- Search in the back.</i>

620
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:32,623
<i>Come on, we're leaving soon.</i>

621
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:39,296
<i>You thought I'd left you
to marry someone else.</i>

622
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:45,333
<i>But do you know</i>

623
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,600
what I will do with this body?

624
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:53,109
This mouth?

625
00:51:58,816 --> 00:52:01,081
I will do all I have dreamt of.

626
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:04,282
And more.

627
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:06,222
<i>And who will call a halt?</i>

628
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,960
Earl Ragnar, the
Fearless, is gone,

629
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,692
and with him Uhtred,

630
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:19,132
his Saxon pet,

631
00:52:20,104 --> 00:52:22,039
a pile of ashes.

632
00:52:31,115 --> 00:52:32,743
Anything.

633
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:43,321
Get down.

634
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,955
<i>Look at that man, the Saxon.</i>

635
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,727
His name's Scallion.
He works with my uncle.

636
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:50,234
He'll tell him that I'm dead.

637
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:52,131
Let him do it.

638
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,364
I see him with Kjartan.

639
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:54,644
<i>Burn it to the ground.</i>

640
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,607
He and your uncle,
maybe there in it together.

641
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,109
What makes them believe they
can do this without punishment?

642
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:03,074
They will be punished,
but not by you.

643
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:05,947
Uhtred, listen to me, we
serve Ragnar best alive,

644
00:53:05,983 --> 00:53:07,315
we tell the story.

645
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,883
- I need to kill someone.
- No.

646
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:13,254
And I choose him.

647
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,061
Uhtred, no.

648
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:20,422
<i>Come on!</i>

649
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:22,330
<i>The barn's over there.</i>

650
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:38,575
<i>The main thing is to keep
the horses together, yes.</i>

651
00:53:40,084 --> 00:53:42,679
<i>Don't leave any weapons behind.</i>

652
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,747
<i>Who goes and who will
look in the back rooms,</i>

653
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:48,725
<i>don't leave anything in
there, just bring it all out.</i>

654
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:17,512
<i>Over here!</i>

655
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,581
Right, come on.

656
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:32,696
You know who I am,
it's me you're looking for,

657
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:35,570
it's me your looking
for, you remember me?

658
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:38,201
You remember me?

659
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,260
There's no more.

660
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,233
We're going. Come on!

661
00:55:03,267 --> 00:55:05,202
<i>Bring the horses.</i>

662
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:14,563
By right, it belongs
to Young Ragnar.

663
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,307
<i>Yes.</i>

664
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:19,537
<i>But we spend what we
need to spend, we stay alive.</i>

665
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,340
We tell the story and then what?

666
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:27,475
We find a new lord to serve.

667
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:36,023
I will not stand by and have
everything that's mine taken from me.

668
00:56:39,096 --> 00:56:40,724
I'm going back.

669
00:56:41,265 --> 00:56:42,563
<i>Where?</i>

670
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:46,567
To the beginning.

671
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,643
Is it Scallion? RAMPART
WATCHMAN: No, My Lord.

672
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,033
He looks like a Dane.

673
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:53,662
Could be one of Kjartan's men.

674
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:20,230
I am Uhtred of Bebbanburg
and I shall take what is mine!

675
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,635
Bebbanburg's mine!

676
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:28,098
Horses!
