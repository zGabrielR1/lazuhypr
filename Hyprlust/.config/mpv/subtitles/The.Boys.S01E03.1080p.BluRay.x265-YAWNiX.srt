1
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:40,666
I'll take this.

2
00:00:58,184 --> 00:00:59,518
Sorry about all the...

3
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:02,063
Oh, don't be stupid.
You did us a favour.

4
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:09,111
- What are we gonna do with him?
- We'll take care of it.

5
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:14,867
The tracking chip.

6
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:16,369
Already disabled.

7
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:19,247
Sit down and relax, Petit Hughie.

8
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,552
Oi, where you think you're going?

9
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:36,889
- I'm going home. I need clothes.
- We'll get you clothes.

10
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:38,975
I want my clothes.

11
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:40,226
I'll be right back.

12
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:43,729
You are, perhaps... in a state of shock, mon ami.

13
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:46,107
Hughie, you just arse-bombed
America's sweetheart.

14
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,359
You can't just piss off.

15
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:53,364
I need to go home.

16
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,746
All right.
Frenchie will go with you.

17
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,915
Wait, what? No.

18
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:05,793
Either he goes with you,
or I break your legs.

19
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,383
Good lad.

20
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:20,057
Translucent's skin, it won't burn off.

21
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:22,310
Where you gonna stash it
Homelander can't find it?

22
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:23,936
Nowhere.

23
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:28,024
But we can slow the cunt down a bit.

24
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,161
Come on in.

25
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,918
Ms Stillwell. Hello.

26
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,211
Please sit.

27
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,306
Starlight, that video...

28
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,101
- Ms Stillwell, please.
- No, no. Let me finish.

29
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,186
The date-rape girl? The victim?

30
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,105
She saw that video on YouTube

31
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,565
and she came forward to thank you.

32
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:54,110
She could not have been more effusive.

33
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:59,323
That's... That's good, right?

34
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:02,576
It is fantastic.
You're polling through the roof.

35
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,871
You have a huge boost with men,
for the ass-kicking, of course,

36
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:08,749
but with women, too.
They love the empowerment.

37
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,377
Sixteen points with females 18 to 49,

38
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,881
even in the liberal retreat jurisdictions
like New York and San Francisco.

39
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:18,676
- I don't know what to say.
- You just have to enjoy this.

40
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,805
This is so good for you.
And it's so great for us,

41
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,807
because it is a partnership, after all.

42
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,476
- This is Seth and Evan from Marketing.
- Hi.

43
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,230
They have some brilliant ideas on how to
capitalise on all the buzz. Gentlemen.

44
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:34,275
- Okay. So...
- Yeah.

45
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:38,070
Now, small-town Iowa girl,
unexpected child prodigy,

46
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:40,114
is chosen for the Seven.

47
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,199
Destiny knocks on the girl next door's door,

48
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:45,202
and she answers, to fight for truth and justice

49
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:48,539
- side by side with her heroes.
- The Big Apple is rough, tumble.

50
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,375
It's got worms. Muggers and rapists
and thieves, oh, my.

51
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:53,711
Dorothy is not in Kansas anymore.

52
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:57,131
Or Iowa. Poor girl gets knocked around
something fierce.

53
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,593
- Kicked while she's down.
- So what does she do? Does she cry in her milk?

54
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,136
- Does she quit?
- No way!

55
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,555
She adapts! She transforms!

56
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,557
Embraces her feminine strengths.

57
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,058
Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road.

58
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,436
And hello, Starlight.

59
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,278
- I can't wear that.
- What?

60
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:23,491
- Why not? It's beautiful.
- Seriously?

61
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,534
It's just...

62
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,579
It's not me.

63
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,789
I designed Homelander's suit.

64
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:32,958
- This isn't my first rodeo.
- You're wrong.

65
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,836
It's totally you.
It's bold, it's brave, it's feminist.

66
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,380
- How is that feminist?
- Empowering.

67
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:42,218
It says you're confident in your own skin,
and you're not afraid to show it.

68
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,845
Most importantly, it tells the story.

69
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,642
Of your transformation...
of what you're going through.

70
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:53,896
How exactly do you know
what I'm going through, exactly?

71
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:58,567
I'm sorry. I appreciate the effort,

72
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:02,655
I really do, but I'm fine with my old outfit.

73
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:05,115
- We're not.
- Excuse me?

74
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,910
Starlight, like I said before,
this is a partnership.

75
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,162
In a partnership, there is give
and there is take.

76
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:12,081
It's my body.

77
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:16,210
I have the right to choose
how much of it I show.

78
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,045
That is true. You do.

79
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:21,840
You just won't be doing it in the Seven...

80
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:24,343
unless it is wrapped in that.

81
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:32,810
Tomorrow, A-Train versus Shockwave.

82
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,436
The race of the century.

83
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,606
The question now, Al,
is can A-Train keep his title

84
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,191
as the fastest man alive?

85
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:41,277
Or is tomorrow the day
he runs out of track

86
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,071
at the hands of this fresh-faced young challenger?

87
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,155
Just wait here, okay?

88
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:48,951
Tomorrow, live on pay-per-view,
the race of the century.

89
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:49,868
Well, Shockwave...

90
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:57,892
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

91
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,371
Hughie?

92
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,916
Oh, hey, Dad.

93
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,125
Look at the...

94
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,503
- You've... This is...
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry about this.

95
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:26,048
I just... I've been meaning
to clean up the Supe stuff

96
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,508
for a while now, so...

97
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,054
What, are you going somewhere?

98
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,390
- Yeah. For a while.
- Where?

99
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,185
I don't know.

100
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,437
Well, now, you're scaring me, Hugh.

101
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:44,358
All right, now, I spoke to Dr Feldman...

102
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,777
- My paediatrician?
- He's still your doctor.

103
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,405
And he's given me the name
of someone you can talk to.

104
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,407
Help you, you know, get back to normal.

105
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,243
There's no normal anymore.

106
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,120
What do you mean, there's...? Look.

107
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:59,248
We've always been very open
with each other, right?

108
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,667
We've always told
each other everything.

109
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,751
- Talk to me.
- Stop it.

110
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:05,796
- What do you mean, stop it?
- Stop it.

111
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,923
I have never told you everything.

112
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,677
I have never told you how much
I hate sitting on that couch,

113
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,595
staring at the TV like we're already dead.

114
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:17,224
How much I fucking hate Pizza Rolls.

115
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,102
- No, you love Pizza Rolls.
- When I was 7!

116
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,606
I am not 7.

117
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,870
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,392
My father was bipolar.

119
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,147
One night, when I was 10,

120
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,524
he tried to smother me
with a Hello Kitty duvet.

121
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,848
Yo!

122
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,605
What the hell is wrong with y'all?

123
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,565
This is not what we do here, gentlemen.

124
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,068
Now, didn't I tell you,
we take turns at the pong?

125
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:55,489
Oslo, Deeaygo, tell me you
put your names up on my board?

126
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,616
Apologies, Mr Milk. No, sir.

127
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,451
Nah, me neither, Mr Milk.

128
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:02,830
Which means that you have cut in line
in front of everybody else in here.

129
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,706
What else does it mean? Spit it out.

130
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,583
That we're disrespecting
the other niggas...

131
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:07,835
Excuse me?

132
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:11,171
All our fellow brothers in the unit.

133
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:14,132
You know how to write
in the English language in a passable fashion.

134
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,760
I know that because I've seen
to it myself, have I not?

135
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,513
- Yes, sir.
- Then place your John Hancocks on my board.

136
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,515
Yes, sir, Mr Milk. Thank you.

137
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,433
At the bottom of the list.

138
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,819
Oh, hell no.

139
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,445
What the fuck do you want?

140
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,447
What, I can't visit my old mate?

141
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,700
Rekindle the unbreakable bonds
of brothers-in-arms?

142
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,119
- Nope.
- Come on, M.M.

143
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,454
Bring it in.

144
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,623
If it's all the same,
let's cut the small talk.

145
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,293
All you're gonna do is lie
and say how you're doing fine,

146
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:52,212
and I'm gonna lie and pretend
like I'm happy to see you.

147
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:53,422
Why are you here?

148
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,010
All right.

149
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,348
How'd you like to come back,
have another go?

150
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,892
No, sir. Keep it to yourself.

151
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:08,770
I don't want to know nothing about nothing.

152
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:12,024
I'm a happy man now. Life is good,

153
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,735
- Monique is back, we're good, just...
- Yeah? How is Monique?

154
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,362
Spits on the ground
every time your name comes up.

155
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,197
I can't do that to her again, man.

156
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,618
Not to mention, I'm actually
making progress with these boys.

157
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,286
Yeah, so I can see.

158
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,708
Don't make me come out there!

159
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,460
Well, this is God's work.

160
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:35,756
I can't argue with that.
But a man of your talents?

161
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,383
- Wasted here.
- Look, Butcher,

162
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,469
we were into some bad shit, man.

163
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,931
Even before the Mallory stuff.
And that, that was...

164
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,310
If I'm gonna make a difference,

165
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,146
I just feel more comfortable
doing it on a smaller scale.

166
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,398
I'm a motherfucker with a heart.

167
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:54,900
Whereas you?

168
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,319
You're just a motherfucker.

169
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,827
Funny you should mention
making a difference...

170
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,166
because we just dusted a Supe.

171
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,126
Bullshit.

172
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,711
Translucent.

173
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,881
What the...?

174
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,302
Well, come on,
you lime-sucking smart-ass.

175
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,346
How the hell did you do it?

176
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,056
Well...

177
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:32,187
Big lump of C-4,
packed right up his fudger.

178
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,607
Boom, claret everywhere,
fucking diabolical.

179
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:39,444
But before the fireworks,
he coughed up a solid lead.

180
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,488
Spilled the beans in a big way.

181
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,906
Now, we play this right,

182
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,283
we could shake up the whole hornets' nest,

183
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:49,413
bring down Seven
and Vought at the same time.

184
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,999
You mean do Homelander?

185
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,838
This is about Becca, isn't it?

186
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,382
It's always about Becca with you.

187
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,384
Oh, you ain't got your reasons?

188
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,307
It'll be different this go, all right?

189
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,268
None of that "secrets and lies" bollocks.

190
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,104
And that Mallory shit
ain't gonna happen this time.

191
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,731
I swear to God.

192
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,279
Are you bringing Frenchie back?

193
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,073
Because I can't work
with that motherfucker.

194
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:27,200
Frenchie? No, I ain't seen him in years.

195
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,955
M.M., you're the only bloke I can trust.

196
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,251
Since when have you ever trusted anybody?

197
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,504
Oh, fuck.

198
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,465
Senator Calhoun, you've gone on the record

199
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,884
- against superheroes in the military.
- Who's a good boy?

200
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,428
- Why change your tune?
- No one's changing their tune.

201
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:51,099
It's just I realised
that it's an issue that affects all Americans.

202
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:54,019
- It shouldn't be decided by congressmen
- Can't you make it stop?

203
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,979
- Hidden in committee.
- He's not crying.

204
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,940
- The bill needs to go to the floor.
- Oh, okay.

205
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,776
Oh, no. We can't have that...

206
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:04,738
You know, I heard Translucent's
tracking chip went dead.

207
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,698
- Yeah?
- He could be hurt.

208
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:07,908
How?

209
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,326
He's got diamond skin.

210
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,535
He's gonna be fine.

211
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,245
My guys are on it.

212
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:15,040
All right, I forgot to give you these. Here.

213
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,291
What is it?

214
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,168
Those are your new talking points.

215
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,588
Now that the military bill is out of committee,

216
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,757
Corporate wants to sell the shit out of it.

217
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,675
Yes. They do.

218
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:31,932
Hey. You remember when
you wanted me in the red cape

219
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,809
and I said, "No. No, no, no.

220
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:36,728
Make it the flag"? Remember that?

221
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:38,855
Yeah. I don't need these.

222
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,357
Okay?

223
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,651
I can sell my way into the military.

224
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,444
Thank you.

225
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:47,405
You take care of your baby,
and I'll take care of mine.

226
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:50,617
Mr Edgar wrote those personally.

227
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,954
So if you want to go to 82
and take it up with him,

228
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,872
be my guest.

229
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,336
Oh, yes.
Oh, you're a happy boy now, huh?

230
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,879
Are you a happy boy?

231
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:13,807
A rental, you cheap bastard?

232
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,101
Who do you think I am,
some double-O wanker?

233
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,687
In case you hadn't noticed,
we ain't exactly rolling in it.

234
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,148
And you don't think this is conspicuous?

235
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,442
Conspicuous? No, I don't think it's conspicuous.
I think a big black van

236
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,571
with fucking "Flowers"
on the side is conspicuous.

237
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,448
This is just another truck on the street.

238
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,537
Bang on time.

239
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,130
Hi. Hughie.

240
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,841
Smelly motherfucker.

241
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,431
- Butcher, who is this guy?
- You'll give the game away!

242
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,726
- Not until this frog gets what's coming.
- Only thing that is coming

243
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,187
- is me on your mother's titties!
- Let me through at him!

244
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,646
We had an agreement about him.

245
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,106
We agreed to put a pin in it.

246
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,942
- What agreement?
- I don't trust this French whore.

247
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,695
I am more American than you,
you racist piece of shit!

248
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,156
- Why are they fighting?
- It is water under the bridge.

249
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,949
You tell that to Mallory's grandkids.

250
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,285
Tell them it's water under the bridge.

251
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,329
- That wasn't my fault.
- Who is Mallory?

252
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,748
All right, the both of you,
knock it on the head, now!

253
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,381
Shit!

254
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,309
Hey, Monique.

255
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,810
How you doing, baby?

256
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,980
Oh, I forgot to marinade the tilapia.

257
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,982
I am so sorry, sweetheart.

258
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,443
Okay, how about this?

259
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,112
How about, on my way home from work,

260
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,573
I stop by DeLuca's,
pick up two fat tenderloins,

261
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:56,451
some portobello mushrooms,
that pinot that you love so much.

262
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,744
Yeah, baby.

263
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,205
Okay, I got to go.

264
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,456
All right, sweetheart.

265
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,083
Yeah. Me, too.

266
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,627
Baby, I just...

267
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,003
You're right, you're right.

268
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,880
I love you, too.

269
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:10,840
Okay. Bye.

270
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:23,979
Fuck all of y'all, okay?

271
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:27,440
All right. All right.

272
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:30,652
Listen, you two knobbers
kiss and make up, yeah?

273
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,487
We got a fucking job to do.

274
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,907
Fuck it. Dégage, huh?

275
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,952
Get out of here.

276
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,496
- Who's this guy?
- The new lad. Hughie.

277
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,081
Hughie, Mother's Milk.

278
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,417
That's a... nickname?

279
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,877
No, my mother actually named me
Mother's Milk.

280
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,213
- Did she?
- So we got

281
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:52,173
a French whore
and a Stephen fucking Hawking.

282
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,633
Great job, Butcher.

283
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,720
It was Stephen fucking Hawking
who dusted the Supe.

284
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:00,682
She's home.

285
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,018
That's Popclaw, right? A-Train's girlfriend?

286
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,273
Oh, Popclaw. Hi.

287
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,607
You know the rent?

288
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:12,986
- It was due last week.
- Right. Of course.

289
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:16,197
- You think her and A-Train are...?
- Yeah, playing bury the bishop.

290
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,074
Didn't hear nothing about it.

291
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,661
According to Translucent,
A-Train knows this bird inside out.

292
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,247
- I'll drop the cheque off ASAP.
- Okay.

293
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,791
- Yeah.
- Okay.

294
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,507
All right. Let's get the bugs sorted,
see for ourselves.

295
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,182
Where'd you get this shit, Circuit City?

296
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,059
Right? He's a cheap bastard.

297
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,357
You know, we don't actually need
to sneak in anything.

298
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,485
Look, all I need's her IPv6 number.

299
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:57,155
Every desktop, every smart TV
in the house has a camera on it.

300
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,782
They probably have one
in every room.

301
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,325
- Even in the toilet?
- No, Frenchie,

302
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,827
not in the toilet.
Look, I just need five minutes inside.

303
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,871
I mean, home service is my speciality.

304
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,296
Hello, ma'am,
we're with Bryman Audio-Visual.

305
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,091
We got the new router. I'm...

306
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,176
This is Hughie.

307
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,220
I'm Gary.

308
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,764
- I didn't make an appointment.
- Oh, well, your manager did.

309
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:26,726
- He's upgrading the whole building.
- I just saw my landlord. He didn't mention it.

310
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,728
I've got a work order right here, ma'am.

311
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:31,564
Only takes a second.

312
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,818
And we can get you all the way
up to a thousand Mbps.

313
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:35,944
That's a lot.

314
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,779
Okay. Come on in.

315
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:47,414
The computer's right over here
if you need it.

316
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:51,042
Yeah. I just need to sign on to your server
in order to download the service package.

317
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:53,294
- Yeah, sure.
- I have a confession.

318
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:55,171
We're really big fans. I mean,

319
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,714
Terminal Beauty 3...

320
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:58,591
Damn.

321
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:01,553
Oh, thanks.

322
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:03,930
Yeah, that one really came together.

323
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,475
Let me know if you guys need anything else.

324
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,102
Thank you.

325
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,579
You gonna eye-fuck that all day?

326
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,581
Let's go.

327
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,596
What is it?

328
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:45,597
Nothing.

329
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:10,246
This kid is full of surprises.

330
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,998
Okay, ma'am, all done.

331
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,959
Thank you, guys.

332
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,920
Thank you.

333
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,755
Get your John Hancock?

334
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,507
- Oh, sure.
- Thank you.

335
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,260
Excuse me, bud.

336
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:37,315
What, you want a autograph or something?

337
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:49,911
Haven't we met before?

338
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,001
Maybe.

339
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,545
I meet a ton of people.

340
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:00,505
Come on, man.
My meter's running out.

341
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,966
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

342
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,884
- Excuse us, brother.
- Yeah.

343
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,014
You trying to get us killed?

344
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,510
Yeah.

345
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,347
I'll be right there.

346
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:53,308
Look, Translucent's probably just lurking

347
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,476
around a gynaecologist's office
or something.

348
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,270
For two days? Come on.

349
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,814
I don't get it. Why is no one concerned
about this?

350
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,317
Because if people find out
one of the Seven is missing,

351
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,943
they panic.

352
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:06,237
Besides, you can't fucking stand
Translucent.

353
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,615
- Give them hell, Homelander!
- Yeah, you bet, pal.

354
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:10,867
Of course. But if something's
happened to him,

355
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,119
then that's a direct attack on the Seven,

356
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,704
which is a direct attack on me.

357
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,665
You've managed to make this about you
in less than 20 seconds flat.

358
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,667
I'm not the one who's down
a point and a half.

359
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:23,129
So I think what you mean to say is,
"Thanks, Homelander,

360
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:26,299
for showing up out of the blue
and bringing the extra press to my collar."

361
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,759
Homelander. Maeve.

362
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:31,429
Captain, you guys are the real heroes.

363
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,348
- We're just glad we can help, right?
- Right.

364
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:35,558
- Where's your shooter?
- Shooter's on 31.

365
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:36,726
All right. Sit tight.

366
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,024
Elevators?

367
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,946
I'm just saying,
a missing team member

368
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:52,659
is more important
than A-Train's insipid race.

369
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:54,911
Mr Edgar wants us both at the race

370
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:58,289
to roll out his new talking points.
You know this.

371
00:24:58,373 --> 00:24:59,874
I've x-rayed Edgar, you know.

372
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:02,335
He is this close to a coronary.

373
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,379
He's got blood like engine oil.

374
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:09,175
And Stillwell, with that mewling baby...
It's ridiculous.

375
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,219
They're just people.

376
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,012
But they snap their fingers and we jump.

377
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:15,223
Why? Why do we do that?

378
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:16,891
Because they sign our cheques.

379
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:21,104
Can we just cut to the part
where you show up to the race anyway?

380
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,565
See, that's why I love you.

381
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:29,696
You're the only one who tells me the truth.

382
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:51,759
It's all over.

383
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,723
It's all over now.

384
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:58,683
There you go.

385
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,988
Goddamn it.

386
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,538
That was my collar.

387
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:21,622
It still is.

388
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:25,042
Yeah, well, I can't walk him
on The Today Show like that.

389
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:27,295
No, that's true.

390
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,213
I got excited. I'm sorry.

391
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:31,090
I'm sure you are.

392
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:32,341
You know the drill.

393
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:33,634
He shot at us first.

394
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:38,139
Attagirl.

395
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:51,110
- The things I let you do to me.
- Yeah.

396
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:52,653
We're not even dating anymore.

397
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:03,539
Fuck.

398
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:14,091
Want me to do the thing?

399
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:16,552
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

400
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:18,387
Okay.

401
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:23,810
That's a good boy.

402
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:40,284
Oh, stop. Stop, stop.

403
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:42,703
Tickles. Tickling.

404
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:47,667
What's the problem?

405
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,752
Shockwave's the problem.

406
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:51,212
What if I lose?

407
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,589
You're not gonna lose.

408
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:57,009
- You're the fastest man alive.
- Until I'm not.

409
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:59,053
You know what Stillwell told me?

410
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,472
If I don't win, I'm out.

411
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:04,725
Nobody wants the second
fastest man in the Seven.

412
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,606
Babe.

413
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:17,154
Compound V. Where'd you put it?

414
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:20,950
Oh, you sure, babe?
I mean, that stuff, it...

415
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,369
amps you up something fierce.

416
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,787
Remember last time?

417
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:26,706
Last time's not gonna happen again.

418
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,125
I'm under control.

419
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:32,628
You ran through a girl, baby.

420
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:35,882
That's not what I would call "control."

421
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,301
That shit's a slippery slope.

422
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:40,469
Take it from me.

423
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,471
No, I... I need it.

424
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,349
Honey, I'll still love you even if you lose.

425
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:47,977
How is that supposed
to help me right now?

426
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:51,689
I have to win this thing.

427
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,108
I don't want to be
some washed-up B-squader.

428
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:56,485
Like me?

429
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,070
No, not like... That's...

430
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,078
I got to go.

431
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:09,790
Why don't you just tell me
where the V is, please?

432
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:12,960
I'll come back to see you
tomorrow after the race.

433
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,713
What are you talking about?

434
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:20,176
I've been meaning to tell you.

435
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,469
Are you kidding me?

436
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:24,764
I have been getting my hair done,
threading my eyebrows,

437
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:27,642
waxing my body
like a plucked chicken,

438
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:31,145
so that we could finally
stand up there together tomorrow

439
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,397
in front of the world as a couple.

440
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:35,900
I mean, it was all cleared
with Stillwell and everything.

441
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:42,865
You did clear it with Stillwell.

442
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:45,159
Look, our time is gonna come, I promise,

443
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:47,912
but I got to get my leverage back first.

444
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,123
Where's the V?

445
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:00,007
- What the hell is Compound V?
- Sounds like

446
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:02,343
some kind of performance enhancer.

447
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,804
- Steroids for Supes?
- Yeah. Well, whatever it was,

448
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,931
he was juiced on it
when he murdered Robin.

449
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:28,285
What are you grinning at?

450
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:30,204
Oh, I don't know, mate.

451
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,707
Maybe it's because the Seven might just be a squad

452
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,251
of manky 'roid heads.

453
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,712
Now, this is exactly the kind
of malfeasance that Langley

454
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:39,255
is gonna eat up by the spoonful.

455
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,882
Not until we're sure
it does what we think it does.

456
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:44,176
If we get a bit, can you work it out?

457
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,720
I can run some tests, of course.

458
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:48,139
But there's no way of knowing
unless I try some myself.

459
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:49,598
Amazing idea.

460
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:52,143
We'll cross that bridge when we burn it.

461
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:53,978
First of all...

462
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,106
we got to get some.

463
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,091
Here's your cover.

464
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:25,634
You're a mild-mannered reporter.

465
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,263
So...

466
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:32,475
Butcher tells me he met you,
what, a few days ago?

467
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:36,270
Yeah.

468
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,230
Yeah, that sounds right.

469
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:40,483
I don't know. I've kind of lost track of time.

470
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:43,027
Talk about a baptism of fire.

471
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,779
I'll mic you up here.

472
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:49,408
So, Translucent, huh?

473
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:52,870
How the fuck did you pull that off?

474
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:56,916
I don't know. Just lucky, I guess.

475
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:59,585
Still. Must have been scary.

476
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:05,299
You want to know
what's really messed up?

477
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,093
Is...

478
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,554
in some ways...

479
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:12,807
just right in that moment, it...

480
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:16,102
felt kind of good.

481
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,606
It's written all over your face, Hughie.

482
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:21,816
What? How can you tell?

483
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:24,318
Because I know
how this job makes me feel.

484
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:28,072
When I had the detonator
in my hand, I felt, like, a...

485
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,032
I felt, like, a rush.

486
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:31,033
I get it.

487
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,994
- Like I felt alive.
- But that rush, Hughie,

488
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:37,081
is no different
than the shit A-Train shoots up.

489
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,791
Everything comes with a price.

490
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,719
The last thing I ever said to Robin...

491
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:56,642
was "Don't you ever besmirch Billy Joel."

492
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:02,648
That was the last thing that she heard
before she burst into pieces.

493
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:07,153
And I got to live with that shit
for the rest of my life.

494
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,536
The price?

495
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:19,123
Whatever it is...

496
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:21,959
I'll pay it.

497
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:31,844
This is the Race of the Century.

498
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:37,266
This is our legacy and our future.

499
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:41,312
Athletes achieving at the highest level.

500
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,150
This is what we've waited for,
the showdown.

501
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:49,361
These men are extremely powerful
and very, very quick.

502
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:51,447
The Train is ready to leave the station.

503
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,909
He reaches speeds in excess
of 1,000 miles per hour.

504
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:57,328
The fastest men in the world
are here in New York.

505
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,538
Who will come out on top?
There he stands,

506
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:02,249
6-foot-1, but a stature that's such

507
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,168
that he's a colossus for the whole world...

508
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:18,474
All right, champ.

509
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:20,935
You got this?

510
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:24,939
- Yeah.
- Hey...

511
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:28,776
Ma is looking down
on us both right now.

512
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,695
Putting that wind at your back.

513
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:34,573
Now, you got this?

514
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:37,243
- I got this. I got this. Yeah.
- That's what I'm talking about!

515
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:39,411
- That's what I want to hear.
- All right.

516
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:46,543
Introducing the newest member of the Seven:

517
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:50,923
Starlight, accompanied by Black Noir.

518
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:58,597
I'm tired of the red tape
and the deep-state bureaucrats.

519
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:01,183
If the people want us in the armed forces,

520
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:03,602
the people can order Congress to do it.

521
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:07,356
- Am I right? Yes!
- Yeah!

522
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:18,951
Sorry I'm late.
You got room for one more?

523
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:22,538
Ravishing as ever, my sweet.

524
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:26,458
Hey, who's ready to see a race, huh?

525
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:30,629
Let's hear it for my boy A-Train.

526
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:32,548
All right.

527
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:33,882
You fucking cocksuckers.

528
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:37,011
Please remain standing for the singing
of our national anthem.

529
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:42,933
Thank you for coming.
It was nice to meet you.

530
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,022
Aren't you cute?

531
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:50,691
Is it okay if I get a selfie?

532
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,527
Of course, honey. Take this.

533
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,866
Look at you!

534
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:00,826
You really dress the part.

535
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,537
It's your old uniform,
but I'm saving up for the new one.

536
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,461
Hey, Starlight!

537
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:12,087
Show us your tits!

538
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:13,422
Come on!

539
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,424
- Come on!
- Baby!

540
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:20,637
- Damn, baby, you look fine AF!
- Lean down a little bit more!

541
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:22,222
Hey, hey, hey.

542
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:25,309
You do not need to press
your luck right now, right?

543
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,519
Kick my ass, Starlight!

544
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:30,731
Sweetie, you know what?
Save your money.

545
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,066
I like that one much better.

546
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:38,030
- Starlight?
- I need a minute.

547
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,199
Where's she going?

548
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:44,870
Let's make some noise!

549
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,503
Glad you made it.

550
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,630
I had a feeling you might.

551
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,424
Remember when we used to just fly off
to Paris, like,

552
00:36:57,508 --> 00:36:59,218
- on a whim?
- Yeah, I remember

553
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:01,303
freezing my ass off across the Atlantic.

554
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:02,930
Yeah, those were good times.

555
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:05,140
Why did we ever break up?

556
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:08,602
You mind if we not crack open
that tawdry little chapter?

557
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,730
Oh, come on.

558
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:18,695
You know...

559
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:20,030
Yeah, kiss her!

560
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:24,618
If I ever really thought

561
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:28,163
that you'd fallen for someone else...

562
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:30,499
I just...
I don't think I could handle it.

563
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,835
- Is that so?
- Yeah, you and me?

564
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,586
We're different.

565
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,713
We're better.

566
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:39,299
- Together forever.
- Okay, well...

567
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,268
Here comes the A-Train.

568
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:52,104
All aboard!

569
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,565
The Train is ready to leave the station.

570
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,974
All right, Frenchie, find it.
You're in the clear.

571
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:33,937
Starlight! Starlight!

572
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:36,273
- Starlight!
- Starlight, over here!

573
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:40,152
Annie?

574
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,321
I love your new outfit!

575
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,324
Annie? Annie!

576
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:46,867
Annie? Hi!

577
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,535
Hughie?

578
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:50,621
From the bench the other day?

579
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:53,248
You're... You're Starlight.

580
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:55,542
That's... How did I not realise that?

581
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:57,878
It's actually kind of comforting
that you didn't.

582
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,379
Fucking hell, Hughie.

583
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,089
You know Starlight?

584
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,176
Well, Hughie, it was...

585
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,512
It was really nice to see you,
but I should get going.

586
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:08,597
- No, Hughie, we need more time.
- Can I...

587
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,933
buy you an overpriced beer?

588
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,768
You know, if you've... If you got time.

589
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:18,774
Throw in some overpriced nachos?

590
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,610
- Lead the way.
- Okay.

591
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,582
No V.
Must have hid it somewhere else.

592
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:37,000
Fucking find it, Frenchie.

593
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:39,169
This is just so weird.
I mean, the other day...

594
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:41,046
Was it three days ago?

595
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:45,133
You just seemed like...
You seemed so normal, you know?

596
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:47,469
- And now it's just...
- Now I'm a freak.

597
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:50,264
No. No, not at... No, that's not
what I meant at all.

598
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:54,017
I just meant... I just...
I wasn't getting Beyoncé vibes,

599
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:56,061
but... not that you don't have that...

600
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,146
- I'm messing with you.
- Okay.

601
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,487
Bad news.

602
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:07,281
- No V.
- Great. We're fucked.

603
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:08,865
No, it...

604
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:13,787
It was really nice to talk to someone
who didn't know who I was.

605
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:17,040
Once you're behind the scenes, it's...

606
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:21,962
- It's different.
- Like how?

607
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:26,800
I don't know... if they really
want you to be a hero.

608
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,428
I think they just want you
to look like one.

609
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:40,272
The other day on the bench
when you were talking

610
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:43,400
about how much you hated your job,
you meant...?

611
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,027
You meant this job?

612
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,365
Then...

613
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:54,328
just quit.

614
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,290
Just walk away.
I mean, you got nothing to prove.

615
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:05,922
I should probably get back,

616
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:08,717
you know, before they send
a search party for me.

617
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,761
- Yeah, totally.
- So...

618
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:14,222
Listen, Annie... Starlight.

619
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:16,850
- What do you...?
- Annie.

620
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:19,227
This is insane, but...

621
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:23,607
I know you're you and everything,
but if you ever just wanted to...

622
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,775
you know, get...

623
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:26,860
Would you like my number?

624
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,950
Yeah. Yeah, that's...

625
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:35,869
That's what I was asking.

626
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:37,329
- Okay.
- Do I call you,

627
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:40,082
- or do I just commit a crime?
- Probably committing a crime

628
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,167
would get me to you quicker, so...

629
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,462
There's a new young gun in town
and I'm ready to rock the show.

630
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:49,883
Ladies and gentlemen,
here comes Shockwave.

631
00:42:04,106 --> 00:42:05,315
You all right?

632
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:07,609
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm good. I'm good.

633
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:10,278
I'm fast, baby. Like, how I roll, you know?

634
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,280
You look wired as hell.

635
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:14,324
Well, it's just Mom's... Her spirit

636
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:16,618
is flowing through my body,
you know what I'm saying?

637
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:18,245
I've got eyes on A-Train.

638
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:19,621
He's totally jacked.

639
00:42:19,705 --> 00:42:21,164
He must've shot up the V.

640
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:23,750
We missed it, boys.

641
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:45,397
I'm out of here. I'll check in later.

642
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,232
Where the hell you going?

643
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:50,110
Just gonna see about a girl.

644
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:54,948
Ladies and gentlemen,
please turn your attention to the track.

645
00:43:27,147 --> 00:43:29,858
Please, clear the track.

646
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:34,613
Set.

647
00:43:50,212 --> 00:43:51,171
Yes!

648
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:54,966
He's done it again! A-Train wins!

649
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:58,929
A new world record for A-Train.
They say lightning doesn't strike twice.

650
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,850
The world belongs to A-Train.

651
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:06,478
A-Train wins.

652
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:07,938
A-Train wins!

653
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:11,399
Stunning! Absolutely stunning.

654
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,991
So, how the hell do you know Starlight?

655
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:23,286
I don't really "know her" know her. Just...

656
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:25,997
We met on a park bench.

657
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:29,584
You get her number?

658
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,673
Yeah.

659
00:44:35,966 --> 00:44:37,300
Hughie?

660
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:40,345
Yeah. Got it.

661
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:41,763
Good.

662
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:47,978
M.M.

663
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:51,147
Popclaw's eyeballing a vial of V
like it's made of Snickers.

664
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:53,400
What, you think she nicked
some of A-Train's stash?

665
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:56,152
That's exactly what I'm saying.
Get over here now.

666
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:59,948
Well, you know what? Shockwave ran

667
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,869
a good, clean race, but there can only be
one fastest man in the world,

668
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:05,662
and that's the A-Train, baby!

669
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:08,248
- Yes, baby.
- A-Train,

670
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:11,042
how are you celebrating tonight?
Any special girl?

671
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:12,460
Well, you know me.

672
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:18,133
I'm always in the game,
but I'm too fast to catch.

673
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,468
I'm open to offers, though, ladies.

674
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:21,928
There's plenty to go around.

675
00:45:22,012 --> 00:45:25,974
A-Train, how have you managed
to stay on top all this time?

676
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,211
Fucking hell.

677
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:56,963
You said it.

678
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:58,381
She's been at it for an hour.

679
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:00,634
Come and get me!

680
00:46:00,717 --> 00:46:03,053
How'd you know
to keep an eye on her?

681
00:46:03,136 --> 00:46:04,554
Okay.

682
00:46:04,638 --> 00:46:06,389
You see that red case over there?

683
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:09,184
I've been around long enough to know
a fix kit when I see one.

684
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:12,771
And she told A-Train
that V's a slippery slope.

685
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:14,731
So she's got experience.

686
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:17,776
I figured if you wait around long enough,
two plus two equals nasty.

687
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:20,278
Sherlock fucking Homie.

688
00:46:20,362 --> 00:46:21,905
Now admit it.

689
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:25,158
This beats babysitting delinquents any day,
don't it?

690
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:27,994
Fuck...

691
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:53,103
- Hey, Popclaw.
- Mr Lutz.

692
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:55,605
- House call?
- I'm just here for the rent.

693
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:58,191
The rent you said you would pay?

694
00:46:58,274 --> 00:46:59,484
You should come in.

695
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:02,195
You can wait there if you want,

696
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,656
but it's gonna take me a few minutes
to write the cheque.

697
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,157
I don't bite.

698
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:07,993
Unless you want me to.

699
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:10,036
That was a joke, Alek.

700
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,454
Alek, right?

701
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:13,164
Okay, let's get that cheque.

702
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:16,751
You want a drink, Alek,
while you wait?

703
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:19,129
- You prefer Alek or Alexander?
- Alek.

704
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:21,965
It's actually short for Aleksy.

705
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,008
I like that.

706
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:24,467
Sounds more exotic.

707
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:26,261
Okay.

708
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:35,270
Like what you see?

709
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,273
No. Yes.

710
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:41,526
I mean, it's... lovely.

711
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,153
It's okay.

712
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:45,196
A lot of guys have a superhero fantasy.

713
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:51,619
I'm sorry? I mean, I...

714
00:47:58,126 --> 00:47:59,836
You know...

715
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:04,924
there is a world
where we could come...

716
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:10,638
to an understanding.

717
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:17,520
Stop! In the name of the law.

718
00:48:17,604 --> 00:48:19,939
Oh, no. Popclaw has caught me.

719
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:26,362
I am gonna sit right here

720
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:28,114
until the cops come.

721
00:48:28,198 --> 00:48:30,033
You're not a cat burglar.

722
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:33,036
You're a filthy pig. Say it.

723
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,332
You're a filthy pig
who likes to eat ass.

724
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:39,084
Say it!

725
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,461
I'm a filthy pig who likes to eat ass.

726
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:45,757
Who likes to eat ass?

727
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:55,642
- He can't breathe.
- No, no, wait.

728
00:48:55,725 --> 00:48:58,269
Hold on. Hang it back. Not so fast.

729
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:29,634
Oh, my...

730
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:35,807
You let that guy die.

731
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:38,685
And he didn't do anything wrong.

732
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:40,436
He was dead already.

733
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,813
That's bullshit.

734
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:43,231
So you can cross a street,

735
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,525
run up four flights of stairs
in ten seconds

736
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:47,277
like some Supe, can you?

737
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,988
And even if you had have got there,

738
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:52,365
she would have clawed
your fucking head off.

739
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:56,119
Now we got her
right where we want her.

740
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:58,204
What? What are you talking about?

741
00:49:58,288 --> 00:50:00,790
You're a smart lad,
but you still ain't twigged

742
00:50:00,874 --> 00:50:03,626
to the one weakness they all got.

743
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:08,423
Their reputations.

744
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:10,592
Come on, Frenchie.

745
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:20,643
Like you said.

746
00:50:20,727 --> 00:50:23,021
Whatever the price, you'll pay it.

747
00:50:24,022 --> 00:50:25,106
Right?

748
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:35,491
Easy. Easy.

749
00:50:35,575 --> 00:50:37,827
We ain't here to hurt you.

750
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:43,625
We're gonna help you
sort out this little mess.

751
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:51,090
And all you got to do

752
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:54,719
is tell us everything you know
about this.

753
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:57,972
Who are you?

754
00:51:00,934 --> 00:51:04,854
All right, I got your message.
Where is the fire?

755
00:51:04,938 --> 00:51:08,733
No, no, not fire. Water.

756
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:10,443
Just ask my little guppy here.

757
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:13,988
You can show her.

758
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:20,203
Well, a very good friend of mine

759
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:22,413
- found this.
- It was a porpoise.

760
00:51:22,497 --> 00:51:25,625
A fucking porpoise found this
at the bottom of the harbour.

761
00:51:29,212 --> 00:51:30,713
Go ahead, don't be shy.

762
00:51:39,514 --> 00:51:40,640
Jesus Christ.

763
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,308
Is that Translucent?

764
00:51:42,392 --> 00:51:44,894
Still think we got nothing to worry about?

765
00:51:44,978 --> 00:51:47,730
How did they even get through his skin?

766
00:51:47,814 --> 00:51:49,899
What kind of a maniac...?

767
00:51:49,983 --> 00:51:52,277
Not maniac.

768
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,113
Smart, actually.

769
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:56,990
Very smart.

770
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:02,996
Hey, Deep, what can't I see through?

771
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:04,789
- Zinc, Homelander.
- Correct.

772
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:06,916
And what's the box made of, Deep?

773
00:52:10,086 --> 00:52:12,714
- Zinc.
- Correct again.

774
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:15,633
They also knew
that we'd find Translucent...

775
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:18,761
What's left of him... eventually.

776
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:20,513
So they were just buying time.

777
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:22,890
Why do you say that?

778
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:24,517
I'm so glad you asked.

779
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,865
Whoever it was...

780
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:41,492
they just declared war.

781
00:52:41,516 --> 00:52:49,516
