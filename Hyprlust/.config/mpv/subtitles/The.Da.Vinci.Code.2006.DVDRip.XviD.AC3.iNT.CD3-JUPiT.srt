1
00:00:01,721 --> 00:00:03,791
I will dispose of the old man.

2
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:06,519
Bless you, Silas.

3
00:00:08,481 --> 00:00:09,630
Teacher.

4
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:19,159
Christ be with you.

5
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:26,716
We're at least a half-hour
to Chelsea Library.

6
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,952
If we're gonna help Leigh,
that's too long.

7
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:41,554
Where you going?

8
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:43,797
Getting you a library card.

9
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:49,197
Excuse me. May I sit next to you?

10
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:51,790
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

11
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:01,229
That's great.

12
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:04,237
Didn't say you had a boyfriend.

13
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:08,069
Thanks.

14
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:11,832
Let's see if we can access
the database on this.

15
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:15,317
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

16
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:17,193
Compounding keywords:

17
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:20,120
Knight, Pope, Grail.

18
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:24,595
Your precious treasure was
almost lost, and with it, my fortune.

19
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:30,996
Can you believe how well I did?

20
00:01:32,481 --> 00:01:34,517
I even convinced the monk.

21
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,238
I should be in theatre.

22
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:48,914
A toast to our success, Teacher.
The end of the journey is near.

23
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,512
Your identity shall go
with me to the grave.

24
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:03,157
There's your problem, mate.
It's your basic linguistic coincidence.

25
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:05,717
See, keywords keep coming up
with the writings...

26
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:08,719
...of some bloke named
Alexander Pope.

27
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,070
"A. Pope."

28
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:13,319
Your grandfather was a genius.

29
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:19,036
Come on.

30
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:53,913
<i>Emergency.</i>
<i>Which service do you require?</i>

31
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:58,990
I know the location of two murderers
wanted by French police.

32
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:04,752
We've just had a 999 call.

33
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:07,191
Triangulation leads back
to Docklands.

34
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:09,392
Caller was male.
Claimed your two murderers...

35
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:12,069
...are hiding at an Opus Dei house.

36
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:24,754
The knight we're looking for
is Sir Isaac Newton.

37
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:29,790
His life's work produced new sciences
that incurred the wrath of the Church.

38
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:32,431
Gravity, for God sakes.

39
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:36,719
And if you choose to believe...

40
00:03:36,921 --> 00:03:41,119
...he was also a Grand Master
of the Priory as well.

41
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:53,749
But if he offended
the Catholic Church...

42
00:03:53,961 --> 00:03:57,556
...the Pope would be the last person
to preside over his funeral.

43
00:03:57,761 --> 00:03:59,877
Well, that's where I got it wrong.

44
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:02,834
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

45
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,999
Sir Isaac Newton's funeral
was presided over...

46
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:09,671
...by his good friend,
his colleague, Alexander Pope.

47
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:14,113
A. Pope. His first initial.
How did I miss that?

48
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:15,596
Here.

49
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:18,953
Yes. Isaac Newton's tomb.

50
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,190
An orb.

51
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:26,111
Yes. Which one? It's not possible
to tell if a particular orb is missing.

52
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:29,711
"An orb with Rosy flesh
and seeded womb."

53
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:34,278
Solar system. The planets.
Constellations. Signs of the zodiac.

54
00:04:34,881 --> 00:04:36,872
See, our moon is missing.

55
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:39,800
The moons of Saturn and Jupiter.
They're not here.

56
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:42,550
Eyes of the cherubs themselves?

57
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:47,279
Robert. These tracks.

58
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,316
Look at the cane marks in the dust.

59
00:04:53,281 --> 00:04:54,634
Teabing was here.

60
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:57,070
He was alone.

61
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:02,954
When the two of you
arrived at my home as you did...

62
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,714
...others might call it God's will.

63
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:09,910
I believed that if I had the cryptex...

64
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:13,239
...I could solve the riddle alone.

65
00:05:14,121 --> 00:05:15,520
But I was unworthy.

66
00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:16,915
But you...

67
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:20,070
You have a reason to be here.

68
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:23,751
You're the last remaining
guardian of the Grail.

69
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:25,992
Your grandfather
and the other <i>sénéchaux...</i>

70
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,078
...would not have lied
with dying breath...

71
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:30,920
...unless they knew
their secret was preserved.

72
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:35,881
How could you know
Saunière's last words?

73
00:05:36,081 --> 00:05:37,036
Leigh.

74
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:40,311
Grail quests require sacrifice.

75
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:42,195
You are a murderer.

76
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:45,279
No. No. Robert, tell her.

77
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:49,110
When history is written,
murderers are heroes.

78
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:53,072
You self-righteous bastard!

79
00:05:53,281 --> 00:05:54,509
We need to just walk away.

80
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,439
- No, don't. Don't.
- Walk away.

81
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:01,074
I'll do what I have to now.

82
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,310
Anything.

83
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:12,674
Do you understand?

84
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:15,834
So now...

85
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:18,992
...can't we all be friends again?

86
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:21,509
This way.

87
00:06:56,321 --> 00:06:59,870
I'm going to put this gun down.
I only want you both to listen.

88
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:02,830
I'm listening now.

89
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:04,755
For 2000 years...

90
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:09,070
<i>... the Church has rained oppression</i>
<i>and atrocity upon mankind...</i>

91
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:14,597
<i>... crushed passion and idea alike,</i>
<i>all in the name of their walking God.</i>

92
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:19,073
Proof of Jesus' mortality can bring
an end to all that suffering...

93
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:22,394
...drive this church of lies
to its knees.

94
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:25,514
Armed police!

95
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:26,989
Drop your weapon!

96
00:07:30,521 --> 00:07:31,954
Stop, Silas!

97
00:07:43,721 --> 00:07:46,713
We are betrayed, my son.

98
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:49,789
The living heir must be revealed.

99
00:07:50,281 --> 00:07:52,431
Jesus must be shown
for what he was.

100
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:55,678
Not miraculous, simply man.

101
00:07:56,761 --> 00:07:58,160
I'm sorry.

102
00:08:00,241 --> 00:08:01,754
Armed police!

103
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:05,079
Drop your weapon! Drop it! Drop it!

104
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,470
Put it down now! Put it down!

105
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,872
I am a ghost.

106
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,509
The dark con can be exposed.

107
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:34,835
Mankind can finally be set free,
and we can do it, Robert.

108
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,520
The three of us.

109
00:08:54,721 --> 00:08:56,040
How is Silas?

110
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:58,471
Is he..? Is he alive?

111
00:08:58,841 --> 00:08:59,876
The monk?

112
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:06,119
Bishop, how would you know
this killer's name?

113
00:09:07,641 --> 00:09:09,233
Get me out of here, Fache.

114
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:10,756
Wait.

115
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,919
Langdon never came to you
in confession, did he?

116
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:21,714
One of your followers called you
about the crime-scene photos.

117
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:27,356
I cannot be implicated here. There are
still important works to be done.

118
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:30,309
You used me.

119
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:34,072
God uses us all.

120
00:09:34,881 --> 00:09:36,314
Help me, Fache.

121
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:38,476
Take him.

122
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:44,753
- Did you get his cell phone?
- Yes, sir.

123
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:46,872
I'm going to need a trace.

124
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:51,359
Your Silas is dead.

125
00:09:58,241 --> 00:09:59,879
The Priory's sacred charge...

126
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:02,914
...was to reveal the heir
at the dawn of the new millennium.

127
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:08,876
The millennium came and went
and the living heir remained hidden.

128
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:12,790
The Priory failed
in their sacred charge.

129
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:15,512
So, what choice did I have?

130
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:21,359
I sought out the enemy.

131
00:10:22,761 --> 00:10:26,993
I persuaded them, the Council
of Shadows, that I was an ally.

132
00:10:27,521 --> 00:10:31,070
I even asked them for money
so they would never suspect me.

133
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:34,394
<i>Rector,</i> I made them call me.

134
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:35,836
"Teacher."

135
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:37,275
- Why don't you and I...
- No.

136
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:39,949
Robert, no words. On your knees.

137
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:41,556
Do it.

138
00:10:42,081 --> 00:10:43,400
No, I mean it. Down.

139
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:47,114
Not you. No, my dear, you...

140
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:51,956
You're my miracle, Sophie.

141
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:54,910
You're the guardian of the Grail.

142
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:59,197
All the oppression of the poor
and the powerless...

143
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:02,154
...of those of different skin,
of women.

144
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,433
You can put an end to all that.

145
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:09,190
You must explode the truth
onto the world.

146
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,360
It's your duty.

147
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:16,795
You know the answer to this riddle.

148
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:19,640
Open the cryptex...

149
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:22,799
...and I'll put down the gun.

150
00:11:40,281 --> 00:11:42,158
I have no idea how.

151
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:44,113
I don't know the code.

152
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:46,881
And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

153
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:54,516
Like your grandfather, then.

154
00:11:55,201 --> 00:11:58,034
Willing to die for your secret.

155
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:02,511
But by the way you've been
looking at your hero...

156
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:07,272
...I wonder, would you
let him die for you?

157
00:12:07,681 --> 00:12:09,751
Open it, Sophie, to save his life.

158
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:11,917
- Leigh, you can't just...
- Open the cryptex.

159
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:13,596
I don't know how.

160
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:15,632
Open it or he dies.

161
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:17,638
- I swear, I don't know.
- Do it! Do it!

162
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:19,069
- Stop it!
- I don't know!

163
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:20,555
Stop it!

164
00:12:25,921 --> 00:12:27,798
She can't do it, Leigh.

165
00:12:39,361 --> 00:12:41,079
But give me a moment.

166
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:52,439
Robert.

167
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:06,116
What are you doing?

168
00:13:06,921 --> 00:13:08,036
Please.

169
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:26,360
I'm sorry.

170
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:37,156
I'm sorry.

171
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,394
No!

172
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,236
No, Robert!

173
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:52,429
No!

174
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:54,196
No.

175
00:14:54,721 --> 00:14:56,791
Oh, the map. It's ruined.

176
00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:05,360
The map is ruined.

177
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:07,515
The Grail.

178
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:09,190
It's lost.

179
00:15:09,881 --> 00:15:11,280
The Grail is gone.

180
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:14,235
Only the worthy
find the Grail, Leigh.

181
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,800
You taught me that.

182
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:21,236
Armed police!

183
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:23,671
Drop it! Drop your weapon!

184
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:25,320
Put the gun down.

185
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:30,191
Put the gun down.

186
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:37,355
That one. The old man.

187
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,516
You're under arrest!

188
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:40,837
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense...

189
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,838
...if you do not mention,
when questioned...

190
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,952
...something which you
later rely on in court.

191
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:47,629
Anything you do say
will be given in evidence.

192
00:15:57,961 --> 00:16:00,156
I'll have some questions for you.

193
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:20,550
Robert! Robert! Robert!
How could you do it?

194
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:22,831
How could you? Robert!

195
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:25,436
To destroy our hope of freedom.

196
00:16:25,841 --> 00:16:28,992
To deny every pilgrim the chance
to kneel at the tomb of the Magdalene.

197
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:30,350
How could you?

198
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:36,758
You couldn't! You solved it.

199
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:42,431
You took the scroll out
before it broke!

200
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:46,429
You solved it. Oh, you'll find it, Robert.
You'll find it. You know what to do.

201
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:48,757
You'll find the Grail,
you'll kneel before her...

202
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:50,917
...and you'll set her free
upon the world!

203
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:54,352
That man there,
he's got the map to the Holy Grail!

204
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:09,157
There was every orb conceivable
on that tomb except one:

205
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:14,040
The orb which fell from the heavens
and inspired Newton's life's work.

206
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,917
Work that incurred the wrath
of the Church until his dying day.

207
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:23,480
A-P-P-L-E.

208
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:25,749
Apple.

209
00:17:39,681 --> 00:17:42,559
<i>The Holy Grail 'neath</i>
<i>ancient Roslin waits</i>

210
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,991
<i>The blade and chalice</i>
<i>guarding o'er her gates</i>

211
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:47,157
<i>Adorned in masters'</i>
<i>loving art, she lies</i>

212
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:51,070
<i>She rests at last</i>
<i>beneath the starry skies</i>

213
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:54,518
I think I know where she's gone.

214
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:57,795
I think the Grail has gone home.

215
00:18:16,841 --> 00:18:21,471
Built by the Templars themselves.
Named for the original Rose Line.

216
00:18:21,681 --> 00:18:23,512
Rosslyn Chapel.

217
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,233
So this is it.

218
00:18:27,201 --> 00:18:29,032
The gift at the end.

219
00:18:29,921 --> 00:18:33,516
"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits."

220
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:37,518
You never told me the joke
Saunière made of you.

221
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:38,989
What was it?

222
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:41,352
He called me a flatfoot.

223
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:43,791
A beat cop of history.

224
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:46,512
Oh, a dumb policeman...

225
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:49,952
...who just does his job
day after day, of history.

226
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:53,756
You know, his father was one.
A policeman.

227
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:58,917
Saunière said he was the most
honorable man he had ever known.

228
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,201
We are who we protect, I think.

229
00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:07,753
What we stand up for.

230
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,520
Jewish...

231
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:24,195
...Christian, Egyptian...

232
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:27,750
...Masonic, pagan...

233
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,439
...Templar crosses...

234
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,360
...pyramids.

235
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:36,750
I think I've been here before.

236
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:38,030
<i>Sophie.</i>

237
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:58,713
A very long time ago.

238
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:02,673
Come along, Sophie.

239
00:20:17,321 --> 00:20:18,356
Sophie.

240
00:20:19,361 --> 00:20:20,430
Over here.

241
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:31,311
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates."

242
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:33,990
Pagan symbols for
male and female.

243
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:37,593
Fused as one.

244
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,032
As the pagans would have wanted.

245
00:20:41,601 --> 00:20:43,273
We're about to close, I'm afraid.

246
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,476
We're just gonna be a moment.

247
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:07,149
Robert.

248
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:35,039
"Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies."

249
00:21:35,601 --> 00:21:41,153
"She rests at last
beneath the starry skies."

250
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:00,793
The fleur-de-lis.

251
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:50,756
She was here.

252
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:55,274
Her sarcophagus.

253
00:22:57,281 --> 00:22:58,839
Mary Magdalene.

254
00:23:00,481 --> 00:23:02,392
The Holy Grail herself.

255
00:23:03,921 --> 00:23:05,400
She was here.

256
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:07,159
Where did she go?

257
00:23:08,161 --> 00:23:10,391
Did the Church finally get her?

258
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:26,835
This is incredible. Look at this.

259
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:30,192
Look at this. These records
go back thousands of years.

260
00:23:31,401 --> 00:23:34,120
They date back
to the death of Christ.

261
00:23:36,321 --> 00:23:39,552
Good God, could these
really be the Grail documents?

262
00:24:00,721 --> 00:24:04,794
What did he want from us?
To find her sarcophagus?

263
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:08,355
How was I ever supposed
to figure all this out?

264
00:24:08,801 --> 00:24:11,076
When you and your
grandfather fought...

265
00:24:11,281 --> 00:24:13,875
...was it something about your past?

266
00:24:15,641 --> 00:24:17,313
How could you know that?

267
00:24:18,001 --> 00:24:20,595
About how your parents died?

268
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:23,159
Sophie?

269
00:24:25,361 --> 00:24:27,477
It was during primary school.

270
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:30,952
I was in his library.

271
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:34,114
Doing research.

272
00:24:34,321 --> 00:24:36,835
<i>I was trying to find out</i>
<i>about my family.</i>

273
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:39,157
Sophie, where are you, princess?

274
00:24:40,001 --> 00:24:42,196
I wanted to know about them.

275
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,758
But I couldn't find any records.

276
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:47,718
Not of their death...

277
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:50,918
...not of the accident.

278
00:24:51,561 --> 00:24:53,791
<i>I'd asked him for as long</i>
<i>as I could remember...</i>

279
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:55,229
<i>... but he would never tell me.</i>

280
00:24:55,441 --> 00:24:57,033
I told you, no.

281
00:24:59,401 --> 00:25:00,754
But why can't I?

282
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:02,873
He stood over me...

283
00:25:04,561 --> 00:25:06,517
...and he wouldn't let me leave.

284
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:08,439
They're dead. Dead and buried.

285
00:25:08,961 --> 00:25:10,519
Never look for them, Sophie.

286
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:11,916
Promise me.

287
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:14,350
Swear it!

288
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:16,156
Swear it to me!

289
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:28,278
I kept my promise.

290
00:25:31,801 --> 00:25:34,474
The next week he sent me
to boarding school.

291
00:25:36,121 --> 00:25:39,318
<i>One weekend</i>
<i>I came home unexpectedly.</i>

292
00:25:40,441 --> 00:25:43,114
<i>And what I saw</i>
<i>my grandfather doing...</i>

293
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,554
<i>Some ritual.</i>

294
00:25:47,521 --> 00:25:49,034
<i>I was so frightened.</i>

295
00:25:53,561 --> 00:25:55,631
We hardly ever spoke again.

296
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:04,036
Do you have any memories of your
grandfather before the accident?

297
00:26:05,081 --> 00:26:07,151
Before your parents were killed?

298
00:26:07,841 --> 00:26:10,309
Yeah. No. I don't know.

299
00:26:11,441 --> 00:26:12,476
Why?

300
00:26:15,161 --> 00:26:17,391
Because I don't think
he was your grandfather.

301
00:26:36,121 --> 00:26:37,998
These are my parents.

302
00:26:40,081 --> 00:26:41,355
My brother.

303
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,639
And this is you, isn't it?

304
00:26:49,481 --> 00:26:52,996
The paper says
the entire family was killed.

305
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:57,156
The mother, the father, the boy, 6...

306
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:01,071
...and the girl, 4.

307
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:07,032
But your name was never Saunière.
It's Saint-Clair.

308
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:12,511
It's one of the oldest families
in France.

309
00:27:13,241 --> 00:27:16,790
It's from a line of the
Merovingian kings.

310
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:26,799
Royal blood.

311
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:30,274
I was so wrong.

312
00:27:31,841 --> 00:27:35,959
Saunière didn't want you to help guard
the secret of the Holy Grail.

313
00:27:37,641 --> 00:27:38,869
Sophie...

314
00:27:41,321 --> 00:27:43,357
...you are the secret.

315
00:27:44,681 --> 00:27:47,036
You survived the accident.

316
00:27:47,321 --> 00:27:49,835
If it even was an accident.

317
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:51,872
The Priory found out.

318
00:27:52,481 --> 00:27:55,518
Somehow they concealed
the fact that you were alive.

319
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:59,272
They hid you with the
Grand Master himself...

320
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:01,871
...who raised you as his own.

321
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,599
According to all of this...

322
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:07,639
...Princess Sophie...

323
00:28:11,281 --> 00:28:12,680
...you are the heir.

324
00:28:14,921 --> 00:28:16,718
The end of the bloodline.

325
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:21,438
You are the last living descendent...

326
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:24,358
...of Jesus Christ.

327
00:29:07,961 --> 00:29:09,235
What is this?

328
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:12,395
Sophie?

329
00:29:15,481 --> 00:29:16,516
Who are you?

330
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:19,076
There have been many names.

331
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:21,319
The keepers.

332
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:23,560
Guardians.

333
00:29:23,961 --> 00:29:26,111
The Priory of Sion.

334
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:31,555
But to you, Sophie, we are friends
of the man who raised you:

335
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:33,559
Jacques Saunière.

336
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:40,955
He would have wanted you to know
that he loved you very much.

337
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:45,669
And that the Priory are here
to protect you now...

338
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:48,918
...as they have always
protected our family.

339
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:53,397
I gave you up once...

340
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:57,073
...knowing I might
never see you again.

341
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:02,198
I'm your grandmother, Sophie.

342
00:30:03,361 --> 00:30:08,435
I have prayed for this moment
for a very long time.

343
00:30:10,081 --> 00:30:12,117
Welcome home, child.

344
00:30:24,441 --> 00:30:25,430
Hey.

345
00:30:35,481 --> 00:30:39,474
She has some things
she wants to tell me.

346
00:30:40,281 --> 00:30:42,511
About my family.

347
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:49,710
What will you do?

348
00:30:50,841 --> 00:30:54,390
The legend will be revealed
when the heir reveals himself.

349
00:30:55,201 --> 00:30:57,510
They just got the pronoun wrong.

350
00:31:00,721 --> 00:31:02,359
She said when Saunière died...

351
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:06,156
...he took the location
of Mary's sarcophagus with him.

352
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:10,115
So there's no way to empirically prove
that I am related to her.

353
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:14,032
What would you do, Robert?

354
00:31:15,001 --> 00:31:19,040
Okay, maybe there is no proof.
Maybe the Grail is lost forever.

355
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:23,314
But, Sophie, the only thing that
matters is what you believe.

356
00:31:24,281 --> 00:31:27,159
History shows us
Jesus was an extraordinary man...

357
00:31:27,361 --> 00:31:29,238
...a human inspiration. That's it.

358
00:31:30,081 --> 00:31:32,641
That's all the evidence
has ever proved.

359
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:35,156
But...

360
00:31:36,121 --> 00:31:37,873
...when I was a boy...

361
00:31:40,201 --> 00:31:44,479
When I was down in that well
Teabing told you about...

362
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:49,640
...I thought I was going to die,
Sophie.

363
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:52,920
What I did...

364
00:31:53,601 --> 00:31:54,920
...I prayed.

365
00:31:56,361 --> 00:32:00,274
I prayed to Jesus to keep me alive...

366
00:32:00,481 --> 00:32:02,153
...so I could see my parents again...

367
00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:04,795
...so I could go to school again...

368
00:32:05,241 --> 00:32:07,391
...so I could play with my dog.

369
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:11,912
Sometimes I wonder
if I wasn't alone down there.

370
00:32:13,761 --> 00:32:16,355
Why does it have to be
human or divine?

371
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:18,358
Maybe human is divine.

372
00:32:19,641 --> 00:32:21,393
Why couldn't Jesus
have been a father...

373
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:24,274
...and still been capable
of all those miracles?

374
00:32:24,601 --> 00:32:27,115
Like turning water into wine?

375
00:32:27,481 --> 00:32:30,951
Well, who knows?
His blood is your blood.

376
00:32:31,161 --> 00:32:34,073
Maybe that junkie in the park
will never touch a drug again.

377
00:32:34,721 --> 00:32:37,599
Maybe you healed my phobia
with your hands.

378
00:32:37,801 --> 00:32:40,793
And maybe you're
a knight on a Grail quest.

379
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:46,040
Well, here's the question:

380
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:49,355
A living descendent
of Jesus Christ...

381
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:53,230
...would she destroy faith?

382
00:32:53,801 --> 00:32:57,316
Or would she renew it?

383
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:02,158
So again I say, what matters
is what you believe.

384
00:33:04,321 --> 00:33:05,549
Thank you.

385
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:08,790
For bringing me here.

386
00:33:10,921 --> 00:33:13,310
For letting him choose you...

387
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:15,150
...Sir Robert.

388
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:25,916
You take care.

389
00:33:27,481 --> 00:33:28,550
Yes.

390
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:53,310
Hey.

391
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:06,676
Nope.

392
00:34:07,961 --> 00:34:10,111
Maybe I'll do better with the wine.

393
00:34:13,521 --> 00:34:14,840
Godspeed.

394
00:35:11,201 --> 00:35:12,429
Bloodline.

395
00:35:15,841 --> 00:35:17,115
Rose Line.

396
00:35:23,641 --> 00:35:25,393
"Hides beneath the Rose."

397
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:18,757
<i>"The Holy Grail 'neath</i>
<i>ancient Roslin waits.</i>

398
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,952
<i>Adorned in masters'</i>
<i>loving art, she lies.</i>

399
00:36:40,361 --> 00:36:43,831
<i>The blade and chalice</i>
<i>guarding o'er her gates.</i>

400
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:25,356
<i>She rests at last</i>
<i>beneath starry skies."</i>
