1
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:01,956
Carol...

2
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,293
Mr. Vice President...

3
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:07,795
Mind your manners.

4
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,702
I'm sorry! I just got carried away.

5
00:02:11,702 --> 00:02:13,635
What were you doing?

6
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:18,292
I was thinking about this story.

7
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:19,974
Story?

8
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:26,928
Yes. The series of strange tales
that started in November of 1930.

9
00:02:26,928 --> 00:02:32,570
Once, we traveled together
on a train, didn't we, Carol?

10
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:38,159
Do you remember what
I said to you at the time?

11
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,495
Let's see...

12
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:44,332
Wow! A rainbow!

13
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,084
Carol...

14
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:50,282
From the time that we were children,
we have thought of rainbows

15
00:02:50,282 --> 00:02:54,175
as being beautiful things,
without any doubts at all.

16
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:56,427
Why is that?

17
00:02:57,595 --> 00:03:00,458
People who do not know
about the refraction of light

18
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:04,247
may also think of it as a
harbinger of a natural disaster.

19
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:10,388
Something unwelcome might be
coming down through that rainbow.

20
00:03:10,388 --> 00:03:15,279
The vegetation may be burning
up at the base of that rainbow.

21
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,188
Why is it that we feel a sense of fairy tales

22
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:23,942
from that bit of seven-colored information?

23
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:26,582
Have you ever thought about that?

24
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:27,959
No.

25
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:31,322
I mean, even if
I did think about it, I couldn't tell,

26
00:03:31,322 --> 00:03:35,078
and besides, our job is
not to think about things,

27
00:03:35,078 --> 00:03:37,802
but to report to others the
outcome of what has already happened.

28
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,807
319 points.

29
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,252
Out of how many?

30
00:03:45,252 --> 00:03:50,537
It's true, our job is to
convey the truth to others,

31
00:03:50,537 --> 00:03:56,182
but the moment that we obtain any
information, be it truth or falsehood,

32
00:03:56,182 --> 00:04:00,518
we must not stop thinking.
We must not stop at just determining

33
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:03,358
whether the information is true or false.

34
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:07,680
Such is the responsibility of those
who deliver information to others.

35
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,960
But, what is there to think about?

36
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:15,687
Just thinking about something doesn't
change whether or not it's true, right?

37
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:17,842
Yes, it <i>does</i> change.

38
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:24,252
Do you remember, Carol?

39
00:04:24,252 --> 00:04:26,343
Yes, Mr. Vice President.

40
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:31,945
A story is neither information,
nor is it accumulated information.

41
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:34,348
It is the result of what has been thought.

42
00:04:34,348 --> 00:04:42,492
Carol, why did you think that these
stories started in November, 1930?

43
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:45,704
Well...

44
00:04:45,704 --> 00:04:49,902
What's the matter, Carol?
And you call yourself the assistant

45
00:04:49,902 --> 00:04:53,267
to Gustave Saint-Germain,
Vice President of the <i>Daily Days</i>?

46
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:54,294
Well, I...

47
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,631
Let's say, Carol...

48
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:04,055
It is 1711,

49
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:11,729
and it would be best to start inside
the <i>Advenna A vis</i>, as it crosses the Atlantic.

50
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:14,263
Or, perhaps,

51
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:17,558
it might be best to start
with the nasty business

52
00:05:17,558 --> 00:05:21,642
that happened aboard the
transcontinental <i>Flying Pussyfoot,</i>

53
00:05:21,642 --> 00:05:24,534
which was covered up.

54
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,412
Either way, Carol,

55
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:35,618
you have chosen November of 1930
as the start of the story.

56
00:05:35,618 --> 00:05:37,658
Why is that?

57
00:05:37,658 --> 00:05:39,090
Mr. Vice President, it's because...

58
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,511
It's because, you see, I thought about
what would be easiest to understand.

59
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:49,617
It was at that point when these
incidents first came before our eyes.

60
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:50,644
That's why.

61
00:05:50,644 --> 00:05:52,672
156 points.

62
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:54,468
Out of how many?

63
00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:57,388
Indeed, it is easier to understand.

64
00:05:57,388 --> 00:05:58,587
But Carol,

65
00:05:58,587 --> 00:06:01,837
you should think about
more than just the time axis.

66
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:04,031
The characters are also crucial.

67
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:05,783
Let's say...

68
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:08,452
Yow!

69
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,080
Isaac!

70
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:14,390
What if we were to look at
that eccentric pair of robbers

71
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,878
as being the main characters?

72
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,546
Or, perhaps,

73
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,550
the young lad,
suffering with a cursed destiny?

74
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,432
Or, perhaps,

75
00:06:32,602 --> 00:06:36,230
the Gandor Family's brilliant young capo?

76
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:37,940
Or, perhaps...

77
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:40,109
If that's what you mean...

78
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:46,154
Charity? Please, do you
have any charity to offer?

79
00:06:46,154 --> 00:06:48,887
The Lord is watching your actions.

80
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:51,412
In time, the Lord will judge your actions...

81
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:54,999
Old-timer...

82
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,836
He seems main-characterish.

83
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,171
"-ish"?

84
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:02,548
Yes. "-ish."

85
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:09,180
I'm in a good mood today.

86
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:10,848
Take it.

87
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:14,851
Thank you very much, sir!

88
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:19,148
The Lord is sure to bless your actions!

89
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:23,722
Quit being so pious only
when it suits you, old-timer.

90
00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:25,638
Just a moment, sir.

91
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:27,865
I have some flowers I picked
this morning, to thank you.

92
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,570
They're probably wilted anyhow.

93
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,580
I'm not so sure about that... sir!

94
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,875
Well, he's pretty close, isn't he?

95
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,652
Say, tell me something...

96
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:07,478
Stay back, you monster!

97
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:13,108
Did you know that I was Firo
Prochainezo, of the Martillo Family,

98
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:13,828
old-timer?!

99
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,918
I see now!

100
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:25,294
"Main-characterish."
You may indeed be right about that.

101
00:08:25,294 --> 00:08:26,257
Aren't I?

102
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:30,498
Still, Carol, depending
upon whom you focus on,

103
00:08:30,498 --> 00:08:34,598
the same incident switches
form in an ever-changing manner.

104
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,212
In other words, there is one incident,

105
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:41,772
but there are as many stories
about it as there are people involved.

106
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,801
Listen up, men!

107
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,998
Destroy everything!

108
00:09:12,998 --> 00:09:15,128
No need for warnings or negotiating!

109
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:17,843
Now, it's our time!

110
00:09:17,843 --> 00:09:22,508
Nobody else exists in our world!

111
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:27,178
Gandors, Martillos, it doesn't matter!
Crush them till there's nothing left!

112
00:09:27,178 --> 00:09:32,156
Make it as though
they utterly never existed!

113
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:41,332
So, what became of that idiot, Luck?

114
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:44,187
Chick-<i>san</i> is handling him.

115
00:09:44,187 --> 00:09:47,546
He's seeing if he still has enough
sensitivity left to feel any pain.

116
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:53,185
Boss, they got us again!

117
00:09:53,185 --> 00:09:54,543
What's the damage?

118
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:57,145
A gambling parlor, a bar,
and a ticket window.

119
00:09:57,145 --> 00:09:59,517
Luckily, nobody is dead.

120
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:04,355
Those Runoratas!
I'm gonna blow them away!

121
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:07,399
Clobber them! And kill them dead!

122
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:12,363
We dragged back one of the guys
that went after the ticket window.

123
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,156
All right...

124
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:20,371
You're the villain that
came after our turf, are you?!

125
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:24,708
You've got a lot of spunk, huh?

126
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:33,162
So you're saying, it starts when the Mafia
and the Camorra go after each other?

127
00:10:33,162 --> 00:10:35,553
In one instance.

128
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:38,708
Luck Gandor has been put to sleep.

129
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:42,685
Word was that he was pretty capable,
but it was child's play.

130
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,567
The Gandors are
a small-time outfit, anyway.

131
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,736
It won't take much trouble
to wipe them out.

132
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,692
We've made arrangements to purchase
some newer, special bombs from certain sources,

133
00:11:03,692 --> 00:11:06,278
so in time, we'll also round up the Martillos.

134
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:10,629
Never mind that.
There's something that I need you to do.

135
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,137
Or, perhaps...

136
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,600
Big Brother Dallas...

137
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:24,977
Where are you?

138
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:29,928
Or perhaps, Carol,

139
00:11:29,928 --> 00:11:36,155
it wouldn't be too surprising for <i>us</i>
to be the ones at the start of this story.

140
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:38,866
We couldn't be!

141
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,835
Dallas Genoard. You know him, right?

142
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:53,833
Yeah. He's the second son
of the Genoard family.

143
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:57,202
He's the son of Raymond Genoard,
whom you killed on your own,

144
00:11:57,202 --> 00:11:59,470
without instructions from me.

145
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:03,502
Dallas Genoard is
the younger brother of Geoffrey Genoard,

146
00:12:03,502 --> 00:12:06,393
whom you also killed on your own.
You follow?

147
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:10,147
Yeah. So what about Dallas?

148
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,848
He contacted the office.

149
00:12:12,848 --> 00:12:17,518
He said that you're the one
who killed his father and brother, Gustavo.

150
00:12:17,518 --> 00:12:19,365
He also says that he has proof.

151
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:24,831
T-That can't be right.
I even paid off the court officers.

152
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:26,288
There's no way there's any proof.

153
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,166
Then how is it that Dallas named you?

154
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,335
Well...

155
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,408
Deal with it.

156
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:36,158
Find him, and bring him here.

157
00:12:36,158 --> 00:12:37,492
Y-Yes, sir.

158
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:39,372
But what about the Gandors?

159
00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:43,082
Dallas has first priority.
Find him as soon as possible.

160
00:12:43,082 --> 00:12:44,265
Y-Yes, sir.

161
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,978
Do I get to decide
whether he comes in dead or alive?

162
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,106
Dead or alive?

163
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,775
Suit yourself.

164
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:05,272
Listen up, men! Get Dallas!

165
00:13:05,272 --> 00:13:08,608
Find that despicable
second son of the Genoards!

166
00:13:08,608 --> 00:13:10,124
Dead or alive!

167
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:14,420
He's going to pay for
making a fool of me, Gustavo,

168
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,045
He's going to pay for
making a fool of me, Gustavo,
What a wretched man.

169
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:15,170
What a wretched man.

170
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,630
and the entire Runorata Family!
What a wretched man.

171
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,464
and the entire Runorata Family!

172
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,093
Say something!

173
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:25,848
Where's the nerve you had
when you attacked our territory?!

174
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:29,143
You were ready to answer
for this, weren't you?!

175
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,803
"Ugghh"? Don't you "ugghh" me!

176
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:35,899
I said say something!

177
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:42,990
Why are you...

178
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,955
You look like you've seen a ghost.

179
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:49,371
You're... supposed to be dead...

180
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:51,540
Chick-<i>san</i>! Chick-<i>san</i>!

181
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,836
Yes? What is it, Luck-<i>san</i>?

182
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,215
I need to ask you to do one more.

183
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,067
Very well.

184
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:05,888
But I haven't washed off
the blood and grease from the last one yet.

185
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,933
So I think it's going to hurt an awful lot.

186
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,769
Sorry about that.

187
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:15,439
P-Please, wait!

188
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:21,111
I'll tell you anything! I'll tell you!
Just don't let that freak near me!

189
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:24,656
Who was it that turned me into a honeycomb?

190
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:34,500
Luck...

191
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:36,715
Firo...

192
00:14:36,715 --> 00:14:39,698
You look creepy when you smirk like that.

193
00:14:39,698 --> 00:14:41,131
What are you reading?

194
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:47,471
"Thy soul shall find itself alone

195
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:51,975
'Mid dark thoughts of the grey tomb-stone;

196
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:55,382
Not one, of all the crowd, to pry

197
00:14:55,382 --> 00:14:59,233
Into thine hour of secrecy."

198
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,739
Long ago, I was so scared of this poem,
I couldn't stand it.

199
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:08,826
But that's not the case now.

200
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:11,653
Not since the incident a year ago.

201
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:12,996
Why is that?

202
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:15,692
Maybe because as much as
I've lost any need to be afraid,

203
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:18,794
I've also lost any feelings of anxiety.

204
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,171
Towards death, I mean.

205
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,634
Firo, don't you think anything of it?

206
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:27,553
Nope.

207
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,392
Forget about it, please.

208
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,450
Be that as it may,

209
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,968
there's been an unusual bunch that
has been hanging around on our turf lately.

210
00:15:38,968 --> 00:15:42,484
Probably some guys who
have the Runoratas backing them.

211
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:45,654
I'll be there to help you,
whenever it hits the fan.

212
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:49,165
Firo, please, pretend you don't know.

213
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:50,868
This is our problem.

214
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,557
That's a pretty standoffish thing to ask.

215
00:15:53,557 --> 00:15:56,597
I'm not going to put the Martillos out.

216
00:15:56,597 --> 00:16:00,127
Don't worry. We've called in Vino.

217
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:04,089
Vino? Claire is coming in?

218
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:08,469
Arriving on the <i>Flying Pussyfoot</i> tomorrow.

219
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,918
In that case, Isaac and Miria
are on the same train.

220
00:16:11,918 --> 00:16:15,117
One of Maiza-<i>san</i>'s old friends is aboard, too.

221
00:16:15,117 --> 00:16:17,478
Then, let's go pick them up together-

222
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,834
And you're certain?

223
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,988
Yes. The damage is severe,

224
00:16:43,988 --> 00:16:47,453
but there's no mistake that they were
passengers aboard the <i>Flying Pussyfoot.</i>

225
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:49,305
How many bodies does that make?

226
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:52,083
The number we've discovered
is somewhere in the teens.

227
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:56,725
They've been left along the side of the tracks
here and there over several dozen kilometers.

228
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:02,303
Inspectors, what on earth happened here?

229
00:17:02,303 --> 00:17:04,303
The matter is classified.

230
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:06,151
You're better off not knowing.

231
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,295
Looks like they were aboard, all right.

232
00:17:17,295 --> 00:17:19,331
Immortals?

233
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:20,791
Yeah.

234
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:24,336
Their names were on the passenger list
at the station in Chicago.

235
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,005
What about the lady's safety?

236
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:30,634
Our orders are to investigate that next.

237
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,140
You think we can keep
an incident like this covered up?

238
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,142
Inspector Sullivan...

239
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,396
What?

240
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,482
There appears to be a survivor
among the passengers that fell out.

241
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,234
What?!

242
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,057
L-Luck-<i>san...</i>

243
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:08,282
Hey. Are you hurt?

244
00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:12,676
Y-You just got shot up!

245
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:20,002
There's no problem, right?

246
00:18:20,002 --> 00:18:21,771
Ee-yow!

247
00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:22,519
Huh?

248
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:24,438
It doesn't hurt.

249
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:30,678
Isaac! Your wound has disappeared!

250
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:32,472
That's an incredible trick!

251
00:18:32,472 --> 00:18:34,531
Maybe doves will appear next!

252
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,053
He's so useless.

253
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:13,612
There's no way you can still be alive...

254
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:16,573
Firo!

255
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,076
Firo, where are you?!

256
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:20,827
Right here.

257
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:22,245
This can't be!

258
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,210
At least let me do this much.

259
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,506
I'll pay for the damages.

260
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:34,952
So what you saw here today...

261
00:19:34,952 --> 00:19:36,947
N-Not at all!

262
00:19:36,947 --> 00:19:38,929
I didn't see anything!

263
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:44,133
Besides, if I ever did tell anyone,
they'd put me in a sanatorium, at best!

264
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:45,143
Still...

265
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,605
it doesn't look like we can ignore this.

266
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,110
I'll find you.

267
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,112
I promise.

268
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,675
The <i>Flying Pussyfoot</i>
is quite an unusual train, huh?

269
00:20:11,675 --> 00:20:16,118
I've seen it once before and
it's overly ornamental, to put it one way.

270
00:20:16,118 --> 00:20:19,400
If I had to say, it looks kind of ostentatious.

271
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,332
I want to see it even more, now.

272
00:20:21,332 --> 00:20:22,973
That's too bad.

273
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:28,088
There was an announcement a moment ago
that the <i>Flying Pussyfoot</i> had a breakdown,

274
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:31,314
and all the passenger cars were
switched to another train.

275
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:33,817
Huh?! Are you serious?!

276
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:37,518
Either way, the lead car will
be switched with a smokeless,

277
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:41,852
electric engine before it enters Manhattan,

278
00:20:41,852 --> 00:20:44,550
so you won't be
able to see the whole thing.

279
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,496
Maybe so, but...

280
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:53,253
Oh, by the way, what kind of person
is this old friend of yours, Maiza-<i>san</i>?

281
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,005
Ah, yes...

282
00:20:55,797 --> 00:21:00,538
He tries to carry everything on his
shoulders, despite being so introverted.

283
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:02,657
That's the type of person he is.

284
00:21:02,657 --> 00:21:05,752
The type who wouldn't last long,
were they a normal person, huh?

285
00:21:05,752 --> 00:21:08,962
Claire is the same way,
for the opposite reason.

286
00:21:08,962 --> 00:21:11,188
Cheerful, but far too obstinate.

287
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:12,898
That's the truth.

288
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,693
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

289
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:21,693
Would you decide whether you're just gonna stare,
or if you're gonna take me in?

290
00:21:21,693 --> 00:21:24,910
Despite appearances,
I'm in a pretty foul mood.

291
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:33,251
If I'd known this would happen,
I would have killed you sooner.

292
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:37,547
Or would you like me to kill you, right here?

293
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:39,841
But, Ladd...

294
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,885
What's wrong?

295
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:45,013
You saying you don't wanna be killed by me?!

296
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:04,533
It hurts! It hurts! Just a minute...

297
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,913
I'm sorry, Nice... Please,
can we go a little slower?

298
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:16,670
Hey!

299
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:19,923
Hey there!

300
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:27,054
Oh! Ennis, Firo, and Maiza!

301
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,554
Long time no see, my fine fellows!

302
00:22:29,554 --> 00:22:31,685
I'm so glad to see you're all doing so well!

303
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,957
You too, Isaac-<i>san</i> and Miria-<i>san.</i>

304
00:22:33,957 --> 00:22:34,521
We're doing fine!

305
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:35,272
We're doing fine!
What happened? You look like hell-

306
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:37,566
What happened? You look like hell-

307
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:41,444
Live long enough,
and I'll tell you someday!

308
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:44,531
It's been too long!

309
00:22:57,586 --> 00:23:07,585
<i>Looking up at the starry sky</i>
<i>that goes on forever, we sing</i>

310
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:21,807
<i>a melody of a dream</i>
<i>we have of our limited eternity</i>

311
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:33,358
<i>The water of adoration,</i>
<i>overflowing in our hearts</i>

312
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:40,322
<i>will reach someone in the distant future</i>

313
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:47,458
<i>I believe so</i>

314
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:54,548
<i>Running through time prolonged,</i>

315
00:23:54,548 --> 00:24:02,012
<i>our voices calling out will</i>
<i>someday become a great song</i>

316
00:24:02,012 --> 00:24:08,728
<i>We can go on spinning our love</i>

317
00:24:08,728 --> 00:24:18,781
<i>though it may still be such a tiny light now</i>

318
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:28,341
<i>Hey, Miria,</i>
<i>where could this "aside"place be?</i>

319
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,971
<i>It means not at home, right?</i>

320
00:24:29,971 --> 00:24:32,141
<i>Which means that it's somewhere</i>
<i>not at home, right?</i>

321
00:24:32,141 --> 00:24:33,641
<i>Then, where is "somewhere"?</i>

322
00:24:33,641 --> 00:24:36,184
<i>I'm sure it's aside, where</i>
<i>the old woman's qualms are.</i>

323
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:39,980
<i>That's incredible, Isaac</i>! <i>You're so smart</i>!
